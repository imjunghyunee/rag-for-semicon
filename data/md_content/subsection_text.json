The electrical properties of solids are therefore of primary interest. The semiconductor is in general a single-crystal material. The electrical properties of a single-crystal material are determined not only by the chemical composition but also by the arrangement of atoms in the solid; this being true, a brief study of the crystal structure of solids is warranted. The formation, or growth, of the single-crystal material is an important part of semiconductor technology. A short discussion of several growth techniques is included in this chapter to provide the reader with some of the terminology that describes semiconductor device structures.",

Two general classifications of semiconductors are the elemental semiconductor materials, found in group IV of the periodic table, and the compound semiconductor materials, most of which are formed from special combinations of group III and group V elements.

Gallium arsenide is one of the more common of the compound semiconductors. Its good optical properties make it useful in optical devices.

    "text": "## 1.2 | Types of Solids\n\nAmorphous, polycrystalline, and single crystals are the three general types of solids. Each type is characterized by the size of an ordered region within the material. An ordered region is a spatial volume in which atoms or molecules have a regular geometric arrangement or periodicity. Amorphous materials have order only within a few atomic or molecular dimensions, while polycrystalline materials have a high degree of order over many atomic or molecular dimensions. These ordered regions, or single-crystal regions, vary in size and orientation with respect to one another. The single-crystal regions are called grains and are separated from one another by grain boundaries. Single-crystal materials, ideally, have a high degree of order, or regular geometric periodicity, throughout the entire volume of the material. The advantage of a single-crystal material is that, in general, its electrical properties are superior.",

Two-dimensional representations of amorphous, polycrystalline, and single-crystal materials are shown in Figure 1.1.\n\n### 1.3.1 Space Lattices\n\nOur primary emphasis in this text will be on the single-crystal material with its regular geometric periodicity in the atomic arrangement. **A representative unit, or a group of atoms, is repeated at regular intervals in each of the three dimensions to form the single crystal. The periodic arrangement of atoms in the crystal is called the lattice.**\n\n#### 1.3.1.1 Primitive and Unit Cell\n\nWe can represent a particular atomic array by a dot that is called a **lattice point**. Figure 1.2 shows an infinite two-dimensional array of lattice points. The simplest means of repeating an atomic array is by translation. **Each lattice point in Figure 1.2 can be translated a distance \\(a_1\\) in one direction and a distance \\(b_1\\) in a second noncollinear direction to generate the two-dimensional lattice.** A third noncollinear translation will produce the three-dimensional lattice. **The translation directions need not be perpendicular.**\n\nSince the three-dimensional lattice is a periodic repetition of a group of atoms, we do not need to consider the entire lattice, but only a fundamental unit that is being repeated. **A unit cell is a small volume of the crystal that can be used to reproduce the entire crystal.** A unit cell is not a unique entity. **Figure 1.3 shows several possible unit cells in a two-dimensional lattice.**\n\nThe unit cell A can be translated in directions \\(a_2\\) and \\(b_2\\), the unit cell B can be translated in directions \\(a_3\\) and \\(b_3\\), and the entire two-dimensional lattice can be constructed by the translations of either of these unit cells. The unit cells C and D in Figure 1.3 can also be used to construct the entire lattice by using the appropriate translations. This discussion of two-dimensional unit cells can easily be extended to three dimensions to describe a real single-crystal material.\n\n**Figure 1.2** | Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice.\n\n**Figure 1.3** | Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice showing various possible unit cells.\n\nA **primitive cell** is the smallest unit cell that can be repeated to form the lattice. In many cases, it is more convenient to use a unit cell that is not a primitive cell. Unit cells may be chosen that have orthogonal sides, for example, whereas the sides of a primitive cell may be nonorthogonal.\n\nA generalized three-dimensional unit cell is shown in Figure 1.4. The relationship between this cell and the lattice is characterized by three vectors **a**, **b**, and **c**, which need not be perpendicular and which may or may not be equal in length. Every equivalent lattice point in the three-dimensional crystal can be found using the vector\n\n\\[\n\\vec{r} = p\\vec{a} + q\\vec{b} + s\\vec{c}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p, q, \\) and \\( s \\) are integers. Since the location of the origin is arbitrary, we will let \\( p, q, \\) and \\( s \\) be positive integers for simplicity. The magnitudes of the vectors **a**, **b**, and **c** are the lattice constants of the unit cell.\n\n### 1.3.2 Basic Crystal Structures\n\nBefore we discuss the semiconductor crystal, let us consider three crystal structures and determine some of the basic characteristics of these crystals. Figure 1.5 shows the simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic structures. For these simple structures, we may choose unit cells such that the general vectors **a**, **b**, and **c**\n\n**Figure 1.4** | A generalized primitive unit cell.\n\n**Figure 1.5** | Three lattice types: (a) simple cubic, (b) body-centered cubic, (c) face-centered cubic.\n\nThe lattice constant of each unit cell in Figure 1.5 is designated as \"a.\" The simple cubic (sc) structure has an atom located at each corner; the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure has an additional atom at the center of the cube; and the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure has additional atoms on each face plane.\n\nBy knowing the crystal structure of a material and its lattice dimensions, we can determine several characteristics of the crystal. For example, we can determine the volume density of atoms.\n\n\n### 1.3.3 Crystal Planes and Miller Indices\n\nSince real crystals are not infinitely large, they eventually terminate at a surface. Semiconductor devices are fabricated at or near a surface, so the surface properties may influence the device characteristics. We would like to be able to describe these surfaces in terms of the lattice. Surfaces, or planes through the crystal, can be described by first considering the intercepts of the plane along the \\( \\bar{a}, \\bar{b}, \\) and \\( \\bar{c} \\) axes used to describe the lattice.\n\nThree planes that are commonly considered in a cubic crystal are shown in Figure 1.8. The plane in Figure 1.8a is parallel to the \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) axes so the intercepts are given as \\( p = 1 \\), \\( q = \\infty \\), and \\( s = \\infty \\). Taking the reciprocal, we obtain the Miller indices as \\( (1, 0, 0) \\), so the plane shown in Figure 1.8a is referred to as the \\( (100) \\) plane. Again, any plane parallel to the one shown in Figure 1.8a and separated by an integral number of lattice constants is equivalent and is referred to as the \\( (100) \\) plane.\n\nOne advantage to taking the reciprocal of the intercepts to obtain the Miller indices is that the use of infinity is avoided when describing a plane that is parallel to an axis. If we were to describe a plane passing through the origin of our system, we would obtain infinity as one or more of the Miller indices after taking the reciprocal of the intercepts. However, the location of the origin of our system is entirely arbitrary and so, by translating the origin to another equivalent lattice point, we can avoid the use of infinity in the set of Miller indices.\n\nFor the simple cubic structure, the body-centered cubic, and the face-centered cubic, there is a high degree of symmetry. The axes can be rotated by \\( 90^\\circ \\) in each of the three dimensions and each lattice point can again be described by Equation (1.1) as\n\n\n**Figure 1.7** | Figure for Exercise Problem Ex 1.2.\n\n\n**Figure 1.8** | Three lattice planes: (a) (100) plane, (b) (110) plane, (c) (111) plane.\n\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r} = p\\mathbf{a} + q\\mathbf{b} + s\\mathbf{c}\n\\]\n\n**Each face plane of the cubic structure shown in Figure 1.8a is entirely equivalent.** These planes are grouped together and are referred to as the {100} set of planes.\n\nWe may also consider the planes shown in Figures 1.8b and 1.8c. The intercepts of the plane shown in Figure 1.8b are \\( p = 1 \\), \\( q = 1 \\), and \\( s = \\infty \\). The Miller indices are found by taking the reciprocal of these intercepts and, as a result, this plane is referred to as the {110} plane. In a similar way, the plane shown in Figure 1.8c is referred to as the {111} plane.\n\nOne characteristic of a crystal that can be determined is the distance between nearest equivalent parallel planes. Another characteristic is the surface concentration of atoms, number per square centimeter (#/cm\\(^2\\)), that are cut by a particular plane. Again, a single-crystal semiconductor is not infinitely large and must terminate at some surface. The surface density of atoms may be important, for example, in determining how another material, such as an insulator, will “fit” on the surface of a semiconductor material.\n\n### 1.3.4 Directions in Crystals\n\nIn addition to describing crystal planes in a lattice, we may want to describe a particular direction in the crystal. The direction can be expressed as a set of three integers that are the components of a vector in that direction. For example, the body diagonal in a simple cubic lattice is composed of vector components 1, 1, 1. The body diagonal is then described as the [111] direction. The brackets are used to designate direction as distinct from the parentheses used for the crystal plane. The three basic directions and the associated crystal planes for the simple cubic structure are shown in Figure 1.10. Note that in the simple cubic lattices, the [hkl] direction is perpendicular to the (hkl) plane. This perpendicularity may not be true in noncubic lattices.\n\n\n**Figure 1.10** Three lattice directions and planes: (a) {100} plane and [100] direction, (b) {110} plane and [110] direction, (c) {111} plane and [111] direction.",

    "text": "## 1.4 THE DIAMOND STRUCTURE\n\nAs already stated, silicon is the most common semiconductor material. **Silicon** is referred to as a group IV element and has a diamond crystal structure. **Germanium** is also a group IV element and has the same diamond structure. A unit cell of the diamond structure, shown in Figure 1.11, is more complicated than the simple cubic structures that we have considered up to this point.\n\nWe may begin to understand the diamond lattice by considering the tetrahedral structure shown in Figure 1.12. This structure is basically a body-centered cubic with four of the corner atoms missing. Every atom in the tetrahedral structure has four nearest neighbors and it is this structure that is the basic building block of the diamond lattice.\n\n**Figure 1.11** The diamond structure.\n\n**Figure 1.12** The tetrahedral structure of closest neighbors in the diamond lattice.\n\n**Figure 1.13** Portions of the diamond lattice: (a) bottom half and (b) top half.\n\nThere are several ways to visualize the diamond structure. One way to gain a further understanding of the diamond lattice is by considering Figure 1.13. Figure 1.13a shows two body-centered cubic, or tetrahedral, structures diagonally adjacent to each other. The open circles represent atoms in the lattice that are generated when the structure is translated to the right or left, one lattice constant, \\(a\\). Figure 1.13b represents the top half of the diamond structure. The top half again consists of two tetrahedral structures joined diagonally, but which are at 90° with respect to the bottom-half diagonal. \n\nAn important characteristic of the diamond lattice is that any atom within the diamond structure will have four nearest neighboring atoms. We will note this characteristic again in our discussion of atomic bonding in the next section.\n\nThe diamond structure refers to the particular lattice in which all atoms are of the same species, such as silicon or germanium. The zincblende (sphalerite) structure differs from the diamond structure only in that there are two different types of atoms in the lattice. Compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, have the zincblende structure shown in Figure 1.14. The important feature of both the diamond and the zincblende structures is that the atoms are joined together to form a tetrahedron. Figure 1.15 shows the basic tetrahedral structure of GaAs in which each Ga atom has four nearest As neighbors and each As atom has four nearest Ga neighbors. This figure also begins to show the interpenetration of two sublattices that can be used to generate the diamond or zincblende lattice.\n\n**Figure 1.14** | The zincblende (sphalerite) lattice of GaAs.\n\n**Figure 1.15** | The tetrahedral structure of closest neighbors in the zincblende lattice.",

    "text": "## 1.5 ATOMIC BONDING\n\nWe have been considering various single-crystal structures. The question arises as to why one particular crystal structure is favored over another for a particular assembly of atoms. A fundamental law of nature is that the total energy of a system in thermal equilibrium tends to reach a minimum value. The interaction that occurs between atoms to form a solid and to reach the minimum total energy depends on the type of atom or atoms involved. The type of bond, or interaction, between atoms, then, depends on the particular atom or atoms in the crystal. If there is not a strong bond between atoms, they will not “stick together” to create a solid.\n\nThe interaction between atoms can be described by quantum mechanics. Although an introduction to quantum mechanics is presented in the next chapter, the quantum-mechanical description of the atomic bonding interaction is still beyond the scope of this text. We can nevertheless obtain a qualitative understanding of how various atoms interact by considering the valence, or outermost, electrons of an atom.\n\nThe atoms at the two extremes of the periodic table (excepting the inert elements) tend to lose or gain valence electrons, thus forming ions. These ions then essentially have complete outer energy shells. The elements in group I of the periodic table tend to lose their one electron and become positively charged, while the elements in group VII tend to gain an electron and become negatively charged. These oppositely charged ions then experience a coulomb attraction and form a bond referred to as an ionic bond. If the ions were to get too close, a repulsive force would become dominant, so an equilibrium distance results between these two ions. In a crystal, negatively charged ions tend to be surrounded by positively charged ions and positively charged ions tend to be surrounded by negatively charged ions, so a periodic array of the atoms is formed to create the lattice. A classic example of ionic bonding is sodium chloride.\n\n**Figure 1.16** | Representation of (a) hydrogen valence electrons and (b) covalent bonding in a hydrogen molecule.\n\n**Figure 1.17** | Representation of (a) silicon valence electrons and (b) covalent bonding in the silicon crystal.\n\nThe interaction of atoms tends to form closed valence shells such as we see in ionic bonding. Another atomic bond that tends to achieve closed-valence energy shells is **covalent bonding**, an example of which is found in the hydrogen molecule. A hydrogen atom has one electron and needs one more electron to complete the lowest energy shell. A schematic of two noninteracting hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen molecule with the covalent bonding, is shown in Figure 1.16. Covalent bonding results in electrons being shared between atoms, so that in effect the valence energy shell of each atom is full.\n\nAtoms in group IV of the periodic table, such as silicon and germanium, also tend to form covalent bonds. Each of these elements has four valence electrons and needs four more electrons to complete the valence energy shell. If a silicon atom, for example, has four nearest neighbors, with each neighbor atom contributing one valence electron to be shared, then the center atom will in effect have eight electrons in its outer shell. Figure 1.17a schematically shows five noninteracting silicon atoms with the four valence electrons around each atom. A two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in silicon is shown in Figure 1.17b. The center atom has eight shared valence electrons.\n\nA significant difference between the covalent bonding of hydrogen and of silicon is that, when the hydrogen molecule is formed, it has no additional electrons to form additional covalent bonds, while the outer silicon atoms always have valence electrons available for additional covalent bonding. The silicon array may then be formed into an infinite crystal, with each silicon atom having four nearest neighbors and eight shared electrons. The four nearest neighbors in silicon forming the covalent bond correspond to the tetrahedral structure and the diamond lattice, which were shown in Figures 1.12 and 1.11 respectively. Atomic bonding and crystal structure are obviously directly related.\n\nThe third major atomic bonding scheme is referred to as **metallic bonding**. Group I elements have one valence electron. If two sodium atoms (\\(Z = 11\\)), for example, are brought into close proximity, the valence electrons interact in a way similar to that in covalent bonding. When a third sodium atom is brought into close proximity with the\n\nfirst two, the valence electrons can also interact and continue to form a bond. Solid sodium has a body-centered cubic structure, so each atom has eight nearest neighbors with each atom sharing many valence electrons. We may think of the positive metallic ions as being surrounded by a sea of negative electrons, the solid being held together by the electrostatic forces. This description gives a qualitative picture of the metallic bond.\n\nA fourth type of atomic bond, called the Van der Waals bond, is the weakest of the chemical bonds. A hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule, for example, is formed by an ionic bond. The effective center of the positive charge of the molecule is not the same as the effective center of the negative charge. This nonsymmetry in the charge distribution results in a small electric dipole that can interact with the dipoles of other HF molecules. With these weak interactions, solids formed by the Van der Waals bonds have a relatively low melting temperature—in fact, most of these materials are in gaseous form at room temperature.",

    "text": "## *1.6 IMPERFECTIONS AND IMPURITIES IN SOLIDS\n\nUp to this point, we have been considering an ideal single-crystal structure. In a real crystal, the lattice is not perfect, but contains imperfections or defects; that is, the perfect geometric periodicity is disrupted in some manner. Imperfections tend to alter the electrical properties of a material and, in some cases, electrical parameters can be dominated by these defects or impurities.\n\n### 1.6.1 Imperfections in Solids\n\nOne type of imperfection that all crystals have in common is atomic thermal vibration. A perfect single crystal contains atoms at particular lattice sites, the atoms separated from each other by a distance we have assumed to be constant. The atoms in a crystal, however, have a certain thermal energy, which is a function of temperature. The thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate in a random manner about an equilibrium lattice point. This random thermal motion causes the distance between atoms to randomly fluctuate, slightly disrupting the perfect geometric arrangement of atoms. This imperfection, called lattice vibrations, affects some electrical parameters, as we will see later in our discussion of semiconductor material characteristics.\n\nAnother type of defect is called a point defect. There are several of this type that we need to consider. Again, in an ideal single-crystal lattice, the atoms are arranged in a perfect periodic arrangement. However, in a real crystal, an atom may be missing from a particular lattice site. This defect is referred to as a vacancy; it is schematically shown in Figure 1.18a. In another situation, an atom may be located between lattice sites. This defect is referred to as an interstitial and is schematically shown in Figure 1.18b. In the case of vacancy and interstitial defects, not only is the perfect\n\n\n*Indicates sections that will aid in the total summation of understanding of semiconductor devices, but may be skipped the first time through the text without loss of continuity.\n\n**Figure 1.18** | Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice showing (a) a vacancy defect and (b) an interstitial defect.\n\nGeometric arrangement of atoms broken but also the ideal chemical bonding between atoms is disrupted, which tends to change the electrical properties of the material. A vacancy and interstitial may be in close enough proximity to exhibit an interaction between the two point defects. This vacancy–interstitial defect, also known as a **Frenkel defect**, produces different effects than the simple vacancy or interstitial.\n\nThe point defects involve single atoms or single-atom locations. In forming single-crystal materials, more complex defects may occur. A line defect, for example, occurs when an entire row of atoms is missing from its normal lattice site. This defect is referred to as a **line dislocation** and is shown in Figure 1.19. As with a point defect, a line dislocation disrupts both the normal geometric periodicity of the lattice and the ideal atomic bonds in the crystal. This dislocation can also alter the electrical properties of the material, usually in a more unpredictable manner than the simple point defects.\n\nOther complex dislocations can also occur in a crystal lattice. However, this introductory discussion is intended only to present a few of the basic types of defect, and to show that a real crystal is not necessarily a perfect lattice structure. The effect of these imperfections on the electrical properties of a semiconductor will be considered in later chapters.\n\n**Figure 1.19** | A two-dimensional representation of a **line dislocation**.\n\n### 1.6.2 Impurities in Solids\n\nForeign atoms, or impurity atoms, may be present in a crystal lattice. **Impurity atoms may be located at normal lattice sites, in which case they are called substitutional impurities. Impurity atoms may also be located between normal sites, in which case they are called interstitial impurities.** Both these impurities are lattice defects and are schematically shown in Figure 1.20. Some impurities, such as oxygen in silicon, tend to be essentially inert; however, other impurities, such as gold or phosphorus in silicon, can drastically alter the electrical properties of the material.\n\nIn Chapter 4 we will see that, by adding controlled amounts of particular impurity atoms, the electrical characteristics of a semiconductor material can be favorably altered. **The technique of adding impurity atoms to a semiconductor material in order to change its conductivity is called doping. There are two general methods of doping: impurity diffusion and ion implantation.**\n\nThe actual diffusion process depends to some extent on the material but, in general, impurity diffusion occurs when a semiconductor crystal is placed in a high-temperature (≈1000°C) gaseous atmosphere containing the desired impurity atom. At this high temperature, many of the crystal atoms can randomly move in and out of their single-crystal lattice sites. Vacancies may be created by this random motion so that impurity atoms can move through the lattice by hopping from one vacancy to another. Impurity diffusion is the process by which impurity particles move from a region of high concentration near the surface to a region of lower concentration within the crystal. When the temperature decreases, the impurity atoms become permanently frozen into the substitutional lattice sites. Diffusion of various impurities into selected regions of a semiconductor allows us to fabricate complex electronic circuits in a single semiconductor crystal.\n\nIon implantation generally takes place at a lower temperature than diffusion. A beam of impurity ions is accelerated to kinetic energies in the range of 50 keV or greater and then directed to the surface of the semiconductor. The high-energy impurity ions enter the crystal and come to rest at some average depth from the surface. One advantage of ion implantation is that controlled numbers of impurity atoms can be introduced into specific regions of the crystal. A disadvantage of this technique is that the incident impurity atoms collide with the crystal atoms, causing damage.\n\n\n*Figure 1.20* Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice showing (a) a substitutional impurity and (b) an interstitial impurity.\n\n\nLattice-displacement damage. However, most of the lattice damage can be removed by thermal annealing, in which the temperature of the crystal is raised for a short time. Thermal annealing is a required step after implantation.",

    "text": "## 1.7 Growth of Semiconductor Materials\n\nThe success in fabricating very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is a result, to a large extent, of the development of and improvement in the formation or growth of pure single-crystal semiconductor materials. Semiconductors are some of the purest materials. Silicon, for example, has concentrations of most impurities of less than 1 part in \\(10^{10}\\) atoms. The high purity requirement means that extreme care is necessary in the growth and the treatment of the material at each step of the fabrication process. The mechanics and kinetics of crystal growth are extremely complex and will be described in only very general terms in this text. However, a general knowledge of the growth techniques and terminology is valuable.\n\n### 1.7.1 Growth from a Melt\n\nA common technique for growing single-crystal materials is called the **Czochralski method**. In this technique, a small piece of single-crystal material, known as a seed, is brought into contact with the surface of the same material in liquid phase, and then slowly pulled from the melt. As the seed is slowly pulled, solidification occurs along the plane between the solid–liquid interface. Usually the crystal is also rotated slowly as it is being pulled, to provide a slight stirring action to the melt, resulting in a more uniform temperature. Controlled amounts of specific impurity atoms, such as boron or phosphorus, may be added to the melt so that the grown semiconductor crystal is intentionally doped with the impurity atom. Figure 1.21a shows a schematic of the Czochralski growth process and a silicon ingot or boule grown by this process.\n\nSome impurities may be present in the ingot that are undesirable. Zone refining is a common technique for purifying material. A high-temperature coil, or r-f induction coil, is slowly passed along the length of the boule. The temperature induced by the coil is high enough so that a thin layer of liquid is formed. At the solid–liquid interface, there is a distribution of impurities between the two phases. The parameter that describes this distribution is called the **segregation coefficient**: the ratio of the concentration of impurities in the solid to the concentration in the liquid. If the segregation coefficient is 0.1, for example, the concentration of impurities in the liquid is a factor of 10 greater than that in the solid. As the liquid zone moves through the material, the impurities are driven along with the liquid. After several passes of the r-f coil, most impurities are at the end of the bar, which can then be cut off. The moving molten zone, or the zone-refining technique, can result in considerable purification.\n\nAfter the semiconductor is grown, the boule is mechanically trimmed to the proper diameter and a flat is ground over the entire length of the boule to denote\n\n\n*Indicates sections that will aid in the total summation of understanding of semiconductor devices, but may be skipped the first time through the text without loss of continuity.*\n\n\n\n**Figure 1.21** (a) Model of a crystal puller and (b) photograph of a silicon wafer with an array of integrated circuits.

The flat is perpendicular to the [110] direction or indicates the (110) plane. (See Figure 1.21b.) This then allows the individual chips to be fabricated along given crystal planes so that the chips can be sawed apart more easily. The boule is then sliced into wafers. The wafer must be thick enough to mechanically support itself. A mechanical two-sided lapping operation produces a flat wafer of uniform thickness. Since the lapping procedure can leave a surface damaged and contaminated by the mechanical operation, the surface must be removed by chemical etching. The final step is polishing. This provides a smooth surface on which devices may be fabricated or further growth processes may be carried out. This final semiconductor wafer is called the substrate material.\n\n### 1.7.2 Epitaxial Growth\n\nA common and versatile growth technique that is used extensively in device and integrated circuit fabrication is epitaxial growth. **Epitaxial growth** is a process whereby a thin, single-crystal layer of material is grown on the surface of a single-crystal substrate. In the epitaxial process, the single-crystal substrate acts as the seed, although the process takes place far below the melting temperature. When an epitaxial layer is grown on a substrate of the same material, the process is termed **homoepitaxy**. Growing silicon on a silicon substrate is one example of a homoepitaxy process. At present, a great deal of work is being done with **heteroepitaxy**. In a heteroepitaxy process, although the substrate and epitaxial materials are not the same, the two crystal structures should be very similar if single-crystal growth is to be obtained and if a large number of defects are to be avoided at the epitaxial–substrate interface. Growing epitaxial layers of the ternary alloy AlGaAs on a GaAs substrate is one example of a heteroepitaxy process.\n\nOne epitaxial growth technique that has been used extensively is called **chemical vapor-phase deposition (CVD)**. Silicon epitaxial layers, for example, are grown on silicon substrates by the controlled deposition of silicon atoms onto the surface from a chemical vapor containing silicon. In one method, silicon tetrachloride reacts with hydrogen at the surface of a heated substrate. The silicon atoms are released in the reaction and can be deposited onto the substrate, while the other chemical reactant, HCl, is in gaseous form and is swept out of the reactor. A sharp demarcation between the impurity doping in the substrate and in the epitaxial layer can be achieved using the CVD process. This technique allows great flexibility in the fabrication of semiconductor devices.\n\n**Liquid-phase epitaxy** is another epitaxial growth technique. A compound of the semiconductor with another element may have a melting temperature lower than that of the semiconductor itself. The semiconductor substrate is held in the liquid compound and, since the temperature of the melt is lower than the melting temperature of the substrate, the substrate does not melt. As the solution is slowly cooled, a single-crystal semiconductor layer grows on the seed crystal. This technique, which occurs at a lower temperature than the Czochralski method, is useful in growing group III–V compound semiconductors.\n\nA versatile technique for growing epitaxial layers is the **molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)** process. A substrate is held in vacuum at a temperature normally in the range...",

    "text": "## 4.1 Charge Carriers in Semiconductors\n\nCurrent is the rate at which charge flows. In a semiconductor, two types of charge carriers, the electron and the hole, can contribute to a current. Since the current in a semiconductor is determined largely by the number of electrons in the conduction band and the number of holes in the valence band, an important characteristic of the semiconductor is the density of these charge carriers. The density of electrons and holes is related to the density of states function and the Fermi distribution function, both of which we have considered. A qualitative discussion of these relationships will be followed by a more rigorous mathematical derivation of the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes.\n\n### 4.1.1 Equilibrium Distribution of Electrons and Holes\n\nThe distribution (with respect to energy) of electrons in the conduction band is given by the density of allowed quantum states times the probability that a state is occupied by an electron. This statement is written in equation form as\n\n\\[\nn(E) = g_c(E)f_r(E)\n\\]\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \\( f_r(E) \\) is the Fermi–Dirac probability function and \\( g_c(E) \\) is the density of quantum states in the conduction band. The total electron concentration per unit volume in the conduction band is then found by integrating Equation (4.1) over the entire conduction-band energy.\n\nSimilarly, the distribution (with respect to energy) of holes in the valence band is the density of allowed quantum states in the valence band multiplied by the probability that a state is not occupied by an electron. We may express this as\n\n\\[\np(E) = g_v(E)[1 - f_r(E)]\n\\]\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe total hole concentration per unit volume is found by integrating this function over the entire valence-band energy.\n\nTo find the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, we need to determine the position of the Fermi energy \\( E_f \\) with respect to the bottom of the conduction-band energy \\( E_c \\) and the top of the valence-band energy \\( E_v \\). To address this question, we will initially consider an intrinsic semiconductor. An ideal intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor with no impurity atoms and no lattice defects in the crystal (e.g., pure silicon). We have argued in the previous chapter that, for an intrinsic semiconductor at \\( T = 0 \\, K \\), all energy states in the valence band are filled with electrons and all energy states in the conduction band are empty of electrons. The Fermi energy must, therefore, be somewhere between \\( E_v \\) and \\( E_c \\). (The Fermi energy does not need to correspond to an allowed energy.)\n\nAs the temperature begins to increase above 0 K, the valence electrons will gain thermal energy. A few electrons in the valence band may gain sufficient energy to jump to the conduction band. As an electron jumps from the valence band to the conduction band, an empty state, or hole, is created in the valence band. In an intrinsic\n\n\n**Figure 4.1** (a) Density of states functions, Fermi–Dirac probability function, and areas representing electron and hole concentrations for the case when \\( E_F \\) is near the midgap energy; (b) expanded view near the conduction-band energy; and (c) expanded view near the valence-band energy.\n\n- **(a)** \n  - \\( g_c(E)f_r(E) = n(E) \\)\n  - Area = \\( n_0 \\) = electron concentration\n  - \\( f_r(E) = 0 \\)\n  - \\( f_r(E) = 1 \\)\n  - \\( g_v(E)[1 - f_r(E)] = p(E) \\)\n  - Area = \\( p_0 \\) = hole concentration\n\n- **(b)**\n  - \\( f_r(E) \\)\n  - \\( g_c(E) \\)\n\n- **(c)**\n  - \\( g_v(E) \\)\n  - \\( [1 - f_r(E)] \\)\n\nIn a semiconductor, then, **electrons and holes are created in pairs by the thermal energy so that the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes in the valence band.**\n\nFigure 4.1a shows a plot of the density of states function in the conduction-band \\( g_c(E) \\), the density of states function in the valence-band \\( g_v(E) \\), and the Fermi-Dirac probability function for \\( T > 0 \\) K when \\( E_F \\) is approximately halfway between \\( E_c \\) and \\( E_v \\). **If we assume, for the moment, that the electron and hole effective masses are equal, then \\( g_c(E) \\) and \\( g_v(E) \\) are symmetrical functions about the midgap energy (the energy midway between \\( E_c \\) and \\( E_v \\)).** We noted previously that the function \\( f_r(E) \\) for \\( E > E_F \\) is symmetrical to the function \\( 1 - f_r(E) \\) for \\( E < E_F \\) about the energy \\( E = E_F \\). This also means that the function \\( f_r(E) \\) for \\( E = E_F + dE \\) is equal to the function \\( 1 - f_r(E) \\) for \\( E = E_F - dE \\).\n\nFigure 4.1b is an expanded view of the plot in Figure 4.1a showing \\( g_c(E) \\) and \\( f(E) \\) above the conduction-band energy \\( E_c \\). The product of \\( g_c(E) \\) and \\( f(E) \\) is the distribution of electrons \\( n(E) \\) in the conduction band given by Equation (4.1). This product is plotted in Figure 4.1a. Figure 4.1c, which is an expanded view of the plot in Figure 4.1a shows \\([1 - f_f(E)]\\) and \\( g_v(E) \\) below the valence-band energy \\( E_v \\). The product of \\( g_v(E) \\) and \\([1 - f_f(E)]\\) is the distribution of holes \\( p(E) \\) in the valence band given by Equation (4.2). This product is also plotted in Figure 4.1a. The areas under these curves are then the total density of electrons in the conduction band and the total density of holes in the valence band. From this we see that if \\( g_c(E) \\) and \\( g_v(E) \\) are symmetrical, the Fermi energy must be at the midgap energy in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations. If the effective masses of the electron and hole are not exactly equal, then the effective density of states functions \\( g_c(E) \\) and \\( g_v(E) \\) will not be exactly symmetrical about the midgap energy. The Fermi level for the intrinsic semiconductor will then shift slightly from the midgap energy in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations.\n\n### 4.1.2 The \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) Equations\n\nWe have argued that the Fermi energy for an intrinsic semiconductor is near midgap. In deriving the equations for the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons \\( n_0 \\) and the thermal-equilibrium concentration of holes \\( p_0 \\), we will not be quite so restrictive. We will see later that, in particular situations, the Fermi energy can deviate from this midgap energy. We will assume initially, however, that the Fermi level remains within the bandgap energy.\n\n**Thermal-Equilibrium Electron Concentration** The equation for the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons may be found by integrating Equation (4.1) over the conduction band energy, or\n\n\\[\nn_0 = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E)f_f(E) \\, dE\n\\]\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe lower limit of integration is \\( E_c \\) and the upper limit of integration should be the top of the allowed conduction band energy. However, since the Fermi probability function rapidly approaches zero with increasing energy as indicated in Figure 4.1a, we can take the upper limit of integration to be infinity.\n\nWe are assuming that the Fermi energy is within the forbidden-energy bandgap. For electrons in the conduction band, we have \\( E > E_c \\). If \\((E - E_f) \\gg kT\\), then \\((E - E_c) \\gg kT\\), so that the Fermi probability function reduces to the Boltzmann approximation, which is\n\n\\[\nf_f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E - E_f}{kT}\\right)} \\approx \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(E - E_f)}{kT}\\right]\n\\]\n\n(4.4)\n\n*The Maxwell–Boltzmann and Fermi–Dirac distribution functions are within 5 percent of each other when \\( E - E_f > 3kT \\) (see Figure 3.35). The \\(\\gg\\) notation is then somewhat misleading to indicate when the Boltzmann approximation is valid, although it is commonly used.*\n\nApplying the Boltzmann Approximation to Equation (4.3), the thermal-equilibrium density of electrons in the conduction band is found from\n\n\\[\nn_0 = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} \\frac{4\\pi(2m_n^*)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c} \\exp \\left[ -\\frac{(E - E_f)}{kT} \\right] dE\n\\]\n\nThe integral of Equation (4.5) may be solved more easily by making a change of variable. If we let:\n\n\\[\n\\eta = \\frac{E - E_c}{kT}\n\\]\n\nthen Equation (4.5) becomes:\n\n\\[\nn_0 = \\frac{4\\pi(2m_n^*kT)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\exp \\left[ -\\frac{(E_c - E_f)}{kT} \\right] \\int_0^{\\infty} \\eta^{1/2} \\exp (-\\eta) d\\eta\n\\]\n\nThe integral is the gamma function, with a value of:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^{\\infty} \\eta^{1/2} \\exp (-\\eta) d\\eta = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\pi}\n\\]\n\nThen Equation (4.7) becomes:\n\n\\[\nn_0 = 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m_n^* kT}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\exp \\left[ -\\frac{(E_c - E_f)}{kT} \\right]\n\\]\n\nWe may define a parameter \\( N_c \\) as:\n\n\\[\nN_c \\equiv 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m_n^* kT}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nThe parameter \\( m_n^* \\) is the density of states effective mass of the electron. The thermal-equilibrium electron concentration in the conduction band can be written as:\n\n\\[\nn_0 = N_c \\exp \\left[ -\\frac{(E_c - E_f)}{kT} \\right]\n\\]\n\nThe parameter \\( N_c \\) is called the effective density of states function in the conduction band. If we were to assume that \\( m_n^* = m_0 \\), then the value of the effective density of states function at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) is \\( N_c = 2.5 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\), which is of the order of magnitude of \\( N_c \\) for most semiconductors. If the effective mass of the electron is larger or smaller than \\( m_0 \\), then the value of the effective density of states function changes accordingly, but is still of the same order of magnitude.\n\n**Thermal-Equilibrium Hole Concentration**\n\nThe thermal-equilibrium concentration of holes in the valence band is found by integrating Equation (4.2) over the valence-band energy, or\n\n\\[\np_0 = \\int g_v(E)[1 - f(E)] \\, dE \\tag{4.12}\n\\]\n\nWe may note that\n\n\\[\n1 - f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left[\\frac{E - E_F}{kT}\\right]} \\tag{4.13a}\n\\]\n\nFor energy states in the valence band, \\( E \\ll E_F \\). If \\( (E_F - E) \\gg kT \\) (the Fermi function is still assumed to be within the bandgap), then we have a slightly different form of the Boltzmann approximation. Equation (4.13a) may be written as\n\n\\[\n1 - f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left[\\frac{E_F - E}{kT}\\right]} \\approx \\exp\\left[\\frac{-(E_F - E)}{kT}\\right] \\tag{4.13b}\n\\]\n\nApplying the Boltzmann approximation of Equation (4.13b) to Equation (4.12), we find the thermal-equilibrium concentration of holes in the valence band is\n\n\\[\np_0 = \\int \\frac{4\\pi (2m_p)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E_v - E} \\exp\\left[\\frac{-(E_F - E)}{kT}\\right] \\, dE \\tag{4.14}\n\\]\n\nwhere the lower limit of integration is taken as minus infinity instead of the bottom of the valence band. The exponential term decays fast enough so that this approximation is valid.\n\n\nEquation (4.14) may be solved more easily by again making a change of variable. If we let\n\n\\[\n\\eta' = \\frac{E_v - E}{kT}\n\\]\n\nthen Equation (4.14) becomes\n\n\\[\np_0 = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_p^* kT)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT} \\right) \\int_0^\\infty (\\eta')^{1/2} \\exp(-\\eta') \\, d\\eta'\n\\]\n\nwhere the negative sign comes from the differential \\(dE = -kT d\\eta'\\). Note that the lower limit of \\(\\eta'\\) becomes \\(+\\infty\\) when \\(E = -\\infty\\). If we change the order of integration, we introduce another minus sign. From Equation (4.8), Equation (4.16) becomes\n\n\\[\np_0 = 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m_p^* kT}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWe may define a parameter \\(N_v\\) as\n\n\\[\nN_v = 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m_p^* kT}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nwhich is called the **effective density of states function in the valence band**. The parameter \\(m_p^*\\) is the density of states effective mass of the hole. The thermal-equilibrium concentration of holes in the valence band may now be written as\n\n\\[\np_0 = N_v \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe magnitude of \\(N_v\\) is also on the order of \\(10^{19} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\) at \\(T = 300 \\, \\text{K}\\) for most semiconductors.\n\nThe effective density of states functions, \\( N_c \\) and \\( N_v \\), are constant for a given semiconductor material at a fixed temperature. Table 4.1 gives the values of the density of states function and of the density of states effective masses for silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium. Note that the value of \\( N_v \\) for gallium arsenide is smaller than the typical \\( 10^{19} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\) value. This difference is due to the small electron effective mass in gallium arsenide.\n\nThe thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons in the conduction band and of holes in the valence band are directly related to the effective density of states constants and to the Fermi energy level.\n\n### 4.1.3 The Intrinsic Carrier Concentration\n\nFor an intrinsic semiconductor, the concentration of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the concentration of holes in the valence band. We may denote \\( n_i \\) and \\( p_i \\) as the electron and hole concentrations, respectively, in the intrinsic semiconductor. These parameters are usually referred to as the intrinsic electron concentration and intrinsic hole concentration. However, \\( n_i = p_i \\), so normally we simply use the parameter \\( n_i \\) as the intrinsic carrier concentration, which refers to either the intrinsic electron or hole concentration.\n\n**Table 4.1**\n\nEffective density of states function and density of states effective mass values\n\n| Material          | \\( N_c \\, (\\text{cm}^{-3}) \\) | \\( N_v \\, (\\text{cm}^{-3}) \\) | \\( m_e^*/m_0 \\) | \\( m_h^*/m_0 \\) |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Silicon           | \\( 2.8 \\times 10^{19} \\)      | \\( 1.04 \\times 10^{19} \\)     | 1.08            | 0.56            |\n| Gallium arsenide  | \\( 4.7 \\times 10^{17} \\)      | \\( 7.0 \\times 10^{18} \\)      | 0.067           | 0.48            |\n| Germanium         | \\( 1.04 \\times 10^{19} \\)     | \\( 6.0 \\times 10^{18} \\)      | 0.55            | 0.37            |\n\n\n\nThe Fermi energy level for the intrinsic semiconductor is called the intrinsic Fermi energy, or \\( E_F = E_{Fi} \\). If we apply Equations (4.11) and (4.19) to the intrinsic semiconductor, then we can write\n\n\\[\nn_0 = n_i = N_c \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_{Fi})}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n(4.20)\n\nand\n\n\\[\np_0 = p_i = n_i = N_v \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_{Fi} - E_v)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n(4.21)\n\nIf we take the product of Equations (4.20) and (4.21), we obtain\n\n\\[\nn_i^2 = N_c N_v \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_{Fi})}{kT} \\right) \\cdot \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_{Fi} - E_v)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n(4.22)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nn_i^2 = N_c N_v \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_v)}{kT} \\right) = N_c N_v \\exp \\left( \\frac{-E_g}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n(4.23)\n\nwhere \\( E_g \\) is the bandgap energy. For a given semiconductor material at a constant temperature, the value of \\( n_i \\) is a constant, and independent of the Fermi energy.\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration for silicon at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) may be calculated by using the effective density of states function values from Table 4.1. The value of \\( n_i \\) calculated from Equation (4.23) for \\( E_g = 1.12 \\, \\text{eV} \\) is \\( n_i = 6.95 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\). The commonly accepted value of \\( n_i \\) for silicon at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) is approximately \\( 1.5 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\). This discrepancy may arise from several sources. First, the values of the effective masses are determined at a low temperature where the cyclotron resonance experiments are performed. Since the effective mass is an experimentally determined parameter, and since the effective mass is a measure of how well a particle moves in a crystal, this parameter may be a slight function of temperature. Next, the density of states function for a semiconductor was obtained by generalizing the model of an electron in a three-dimensional infinite potential well. This theoretical function may also not agree exactly with experiment. However, the difference between the theoretical value and the experimental value of \\( n_i \\) is approximately a factor of 2, which, in many cases, is not significant. Table 4.2 lists the commonly accepted values of \\( n_i \\) for silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is a very strong function of temperature.\n\n**Table 4.2** | Commonly accepted values of \\( n_i \\) at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\)\n\n| Material        | \\( n_i \\) (\\(\\text{cm}^{-3}\\)) |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Silicon         | \\( n_i = 1.5 \\times 10^{10} \\) |\n| Gallium arsenide| \\( n_i = 1.8 \\times 10^6 \\)    |\n| Germanium       | \\( n_i = 2.4 \\times 10^{13} \\) |\n\n*Various references may list slightly different values of the intrinsic silicon concentration at room temperature. In general, they are all between \\( 1 \\times 10^{10} \\) and \\( 1.5 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\). This difference is, in most cases, not significant.*\n\n\\[\n[01 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\times 1.01 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\times (0.0259)(1/u) \\times 1.01 \\times 6.2 \\times (00)^{1/2} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}]\n\\]\n\nFigure 4.2 is a plot of \\( n_i \\) from Equation (4.23) for silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium as a function of temperature. As seen in the figure, the value of \\( n_i \\) for these semiconductors may easily vary over several orders of magnitude as the temperature changes over a reasonable range.\n\n**Figure 4.2** The intrinsic carrier concentration of Ge, Si, and GaAs as a function of temperature. (From Sze [14].)\n\n### 4.1.4 The Intrinsic Fermi-Level Position\n\nWe have qualitatively argued that the Fermi energy level is located near the center of the forbidden bandgap for the intrinsic semiconductor. We can specifically calculate the intrinsic Fermi-level position. Since the electron and hole concentrations are equal, setting Equations (4.20) and (4.21) equal to each other, we have\n\n\\[\nN_c \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(E_c - E_F)}{kT}\\right] = N_v \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(E_F - E_v)}{kT}\\right]\n\\]\n\n(4.24)\n\nIf we take the natural log of both sides of this equation and solve for \\( E_{Fi} \\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nE_{Fi} = \\frac{1}{2} (E_c + E_v) + \\frac{1}{2} kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_v}{N_c} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.25)\n\nFrom the definitions for \\( N_c \\) and \\( N_v \\) given by Equations (4.10) and (4.18), respectively, Equation (4.25) may be written as\n\n\\[\nE_{Fi} = \\frac{1}{2} (E_c + E_v) + \\frac{3}{4} kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{m_h^*}{m_e^*} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.26a)\n\nThe first term, \\(\\frac{1}{2} (E_c + E_v)\\), is the energy exactly midway between \\( E_c \\) and \\( E_v \\), or the midgap energy.

The density of states function is directly related to the carrier effective mass; thus, a larger effective mass means a larger density of states function. The intrinsic Fermi level must shift away from the band with the larger density of states in order to maintain equal numbers of electrons and holes.",

    "text": "## 4.2 DOPANT ATOMS AND ENERGY LEVELS\n\nThe intrinsic semiconductor may be an interesting material, but the real power of semiconductors is realized by adding small, controlled amounts of specific dopant, or impurity, atoms. This doping process, described briefly in Chapter 1, can greatly alter the electrical characteristics of the semiconductor. The doped semiconductor, called an extrinsic material, is the primary reason we can fabricate the various semiconductor devices that we will consider in later chapters.\n\n### 4.2.1 Qualitative Description\n\nIn Chapter 3, we discussed the covalent bonding of silicon and considered the simple two-dimensional representation of the single-crystal silicon lattice as shown in Figure 4.3. Now consider adding a group V element, such as phosphorus, as a substitutional impurity. The group V element has five valence electrons. Four of these will contribute to the covalent bonding with the silicon atoms, leaving the fifth more loosely bound to the phosphorus atom. This effect is schematically shown in Figure 4.4. We refer to the fifth valence electron as a donor electron.\n\nThe phosphorus atom without the donor electron is positively charged. At very low temperatures, the donor electron is bound to the phosphorus atom. However, by intuition, it should seem clear that the energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band is considerably less than that for the electrons involved in the covalent bonding. Figure 4.5 shows the energy-band diagram that we would expect. The energy level, \\( E_D \\), is the energy state of the donor electron.\n\n**Figure 4.5** | The energy-band diagram showing (a) the discrete donor energy state and (b) the effect of a donor state being ionized.\n\nIf a small amount of energy, such as thermal energy, is added to the donor electron, it can be elevated into the conduction band, leaving behind a positively charged phosphorus ion. The electron in the conduction band can now move through the crystal generating a current, while the positively charged ion is fixed in the crystal. This type of impurity atom donates an electron to the conduction band and so is called a **donor impurity atom**. The donor impurity atoms add electrons to the conduction band without creating holes in the valence band. The resulting material is referred to as an **n-type semiconductor** (n for the negatively charged electron).\n\nNow consider adding a group III element, such as boron, as a **substitutional impurity** to silicon. The group III element has three valence electrons, which are all taken up in the covalent bonding. As shown in Figure 4.6a, one covalent bonding position appears to be empty. If an electron were to occupy this “empty” position, its energy would have to be greater than that of the valence electrons, since the net charge state of the boron atom would now be negative. However, the electron occupying this “empty” position does not have sufficient energy to be in the conduction band, so its energy is far smaller than the conduction-band energy. Figure 4.6b shows how valence electrons may gain a small amount of thermal energy and move about in the lattice.\n\n!Silicon lattice representation\n\n**Figure 4.6** | Two-dimensional representation of a silicon lattice (a) doped with a boron atom and (b) showing the ionization of the boron atom resulting in a hole.\n\n**Figure 4.7**\n\nThe energy-band diagram showing (a) the discrete acceptor energy state and (b) the effect of an acceptor state being ionized.\n\n\nThe crystal. The \"empty\" position associated with the boron atom becomes occupied, and other valence electron positions become vacated. These other vacated electron positions can be thought of as holes in the semiconductor material.\n\nFigure 4.7 shows the expected energy state of the \"empty\" position and also the formation of a hole in the valence band. The hole can move through the crystal generating a current, while the negatively charged boron atom is fixed in the crystal. The group III atom accepts an electron from the valence band and so is referred to as an **acceptor impurity atom**. The acceptor atom can generate holes in the valence band without generating electrons in the conduction band. This type of semiconductor material is referred to as a **p type material** (p for the positively charged hole).\n\nThe pure single-crystal semiconductor material is called an intrinsic material. Adding controlled amounts of dopant atoms, either donors or acceptors, creates a material called an **extrinsic semiconductor**. An extrinsic semiconductor will have either a preponderance of electrons (n type) or a preponderance of holes (p type).\n\n### 4.2.2 Ionization Energy\n\nWe can calculate the approximate distance of the donor electron from the donor impurity ion, and also the approximate energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band. This energy is referred to as the **ionization energy**. We will use the Bohr model of the atom for these calculations. The justification for using this model is that the most probable distance of an electron from the nucleus in a hydrogen atom, determined from quantum mechanics, is the same as the Bohr radius. The energy levels in the hydrogen atom determined from quantum mechanics are also the same as obtained from the Bohr theory.\n\nIn the case of the donor impurity atom, we may visualize the donor electron orbiting the donor ion, which is embedded in the semiconductor material. We will need to use the permittivity of the semiconductor material in the calculations rather than the permittivity of free space as is used in the case of the hydrogen atom. We will also use the effective mass of the electron in the calculations.\n\nThe analysis begins by setting the coulomb force of attraction between the electron and ion equal to the centripetal force of the orbiting electron. This condition will give a steady orbit. We have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon r} = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n\\]\n\n(4.27)\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the magnitude of the velocity and \\( r \\) is the radius of the orbit. If we assume the angular momentum is also quantized, then we can write\n\n\\[\nm^* r_n v = n\\hbar\n\\]\n\n(4.28)\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is a positive integer. Solving for \\( v \\) from Equation (4.28), substituting into Equation (4.27), and solving for the radius, we obtain\n\n\\[\nr_n = \\frac{n^2 \\hbar^2 4\\pi \\varepsilon}{m^* e^2}\n\\]\n\n(4.29)\n\nThe assumption of the angular momentum being quantized leads to the radius also being quantized.\n\nThe Bohr radius is defined as\n\n\\[\na_0 = \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon \\hbar^2}{m_0 e^2} = 0.53 \\, \\text{Å}\n\\]\n\n(4.30)\n\nWe can normalize the radius of the donor orbital to that of the Bohr radius, which gives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r_n}{a_0} = n^2 \\varepsilon_r \\left( \\frac{m_0}{m^*} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhere \\( \\varepsilon_r \\) is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor material, \\( m_0 \\) is the rest mass of an electron, and \\( m^* \\) is the conductivity effective mass of the electron in the semiconductor. \n\nIf we consider the lowest energy state in which \\( n = 1 \\) and if we consider silicon in which \\( \\varepsilon_r = 11.7 \\) and the conductivity effective mass is \\( m^*/m_0 = 0.26 \\), then we have that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r_1}{a_0} = 45\n\\]\n\n(4.32)\n\nor \\( r_1 = 23.9 \\, \\text{Å} \\). This radius corresponds to approximately four lattice constants of silicon. Recall that one unit cell in silicon effectively contains eight atoms, so the radius of the orbiting donor electron encompasses many silicon atoms. The donor electron is not tightly bound to the donor atom.\n\nThe total energy of the orbiting electron is given by\n\n\\[\nE = T + V\n\\]\n\n(4.33)\n\nwhere \\( T \\) is the kinetic energy and \\( V \\) is the potential energy of the electron. The kinetic energy is\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{1}{2} m^* v^2\n\\]\n\n(4.34)\n\n\n*The conductivity effective mass is used when electrons and holes are in motion. See Appendix F for a discussion of effective mass concepts.*\n\nUsing the velocity \\( v \\) from Equation (4.28) and the radius \\( r_n \\) from Equation (4.29), the kinetic energy becomes\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{m^* e^4}{2(n\\hbar)^2(4\\pi \\varepsilon)^2}\n\\]\n\n(4.35)\n\nThe potential energy is\n\n\\[\nV = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon} = -\\frac{m^* e^4}{(n\\hbar)^2(4\\pi \\varepsilon)^2}\n\\]\n\n(4.36)\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, so that\n\n\\[\nE = T + V = -\\frac{m^* e^4}{2(n\\hbar)^2(4\\pi \\varepsilon)^2}\n\\]\n\n(4.37)\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, \\( m^* = m_0 \\) and \\( \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_0 \\). The ionization energy of the hydrogen atom in the lowest energy state is then \\( E = -13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\). If we consider silicon, the ionization energy is \\( E = -25.8 \\, \\text{meV} \\), much less than the bandgap energy of silicon. This energy is the approximate ionization energy of the donor atom, or the energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band.\n\nFor ordinary donor impurities such as phosphorus or arsenic in silicon or germanium, this hydrogenic model works quite well and gives some indication of the magnitudes of the ionization energies involved. Table 4.3 lists the actual experimentally measured ionization energies for a few impurities in silicon and germanium. Germanium and silicon have different relative dielectric constants and effective masses; thus, we expect the ionization energies to differ.\n\n### 4.2.3 Group III–V Semiconductors\n\nIn the previous sections, we have discussed the donor and acceptor impurities in a group IV semiconductor, such as silicon. The situation in the group III–V compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, is more complicated. Group II elements, such as beryllium, zinc, and cadmium, can enter the lattice as substitutional impurities, replacing the group III gallium element to become acceptor impurities. Similarly, group VI elements, such as selenium and tellurium, can enter the lattice substitutionally, replacing the group V arsenic element to become donor impurities. The corresponding ionization energies for these impurities are smaller than those for the impurities in silicon. The ionization energies for the donors in gallium arsenide.\n\n**Table 4.3** Impurity ionization energies in silicon and germanium\n\n| Impurity  | Ionization energy (eV) | |\n|-----------|------------------------|---|\n|           | Si     | Ge            |\n| **Donors**|        |               |\n| Phosphorus| 0.045  | 0.012         |\n| Arsenic   | 0.05   | 0.0127        |\n| **Acceptors**|     |               |\n| Boron     | 0.045  | 0.0104        |\n| Aluminum  | 0.06   | 0.0102        |",

If a silicon atom replaces a gallium atom, the silicon impurity will act as a donor, but if the silicon atom replaces an arsenic atom, then the silicon impurity will act as an acceptor. The same is true for germanium as an impurity atom. Such impurities are called amphoteric. Experimentally in gallium arsenide, it is found that germanium is predominantly an acceptor and silicon is predominantly a donor. Table 4.4 lists the ionization energies for the various impurity atoms in gallium arsenide.\n\nWe defined an intrinsic semiconductor as a material with no impurity atoms present in the crystal. An extrinsic semiconductor is defined as a semiconductor in which controlled amounts of specific dopant or impurity atoms have been added so that the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are different from the intrinsic carrier concentration. One type of carrier will predominate in an extrinsic semiconductor.\n\n### 4.3.1 Equilibrium Distribution of Electrons and Holes\n\nAdding donor or acceptor impurity atoms to a semiconductor will change the distribution of electrons and holes in the material. Since the Fermi energy is related to the distribution function, the Fermi energy will change as dopant atoms are added.\n\n**Figure 4.8** | Density of states functions, Fermi–Dirac probability function, and areas representing electron and hole concentrations for the case when \\( E_F \\) is above the intrinsic Fermi energy.\n\n\nIf the Fermi energy changes from near the midgap value, the density of electrons in the conduction band and the density of holes in the valence band will change. These effects are shown in Figures 4.8 and 4.9. Figure 4.8 shows the case for \\( E_F > E_{Fi} \\) and Figure 4.9 shows the case for \\( E_F < E_{Fi} \\). When \\( E_F > E_{Fi} \\), the electron concentration is larger than the hole concentration, and when \\( E_F < E_{Fi} \\), the hole concentration is larger than the electron concentration. When the density of electrons is greater than the density of holes, the semiconductor is n type; donor impurity atoms have been added. When the density of holes is greater than the density of electrons, the semiconductor is p type; acceptor impurity atoms have been added. The Fermi energy level in a semiconductor changes as the electron and hole concentrations change and, again, the Fermi energy changes as donor or acceptor impurities are added. The change in the Fermi level as a function of impurity concentrations is considered in Section 4.6.\n\n**Figure 4.9** Density of states functions, Fermi–Dirac probability function, and areas representing electron and hole concentrations for the case when \\( E_F \\) is below the intrinsic Fermi energy.\n\nThe expressions previously derived for the **thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes**, given by Equations (4.11) and (4.19), are general equations for \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) in terms of the Fermi energy. These equations are again given as\n\n\\[\nn_0 = N_c \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\np_0 = N_v \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAs we just discussed, the Fermi energy may vary through the bandgap energy, which will then change the values of \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\).\n\nIn the previous example, since \\( n_0 > p_0 \\), the semiconductor is n-type. In an n-type semiconductor, electrons are referred to as the majority carrier and holes as the minority carrier. By comparing the relative values of \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) in the example, it is easy to see how this designation came about. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor where \\( p_0 > n_0 \\), holes are the majority carrier and electrons are the minority carrier.\n\nWe may derive another form of the equations for the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes. If we add and subtract an intrinsic Fermi energy in the exponent of Equation (4.11), we can write\n\n\\[\nn_0 = N_c \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(E_c - E_{Fi}) + (E_F - E_{Fi})}{kT}\\right) \\tag{4.38a}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nn_0 = N_c \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(E_c - E_{Fi})}{kT}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT}\\right) \\tag{4.38b}\n\\]\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is given by Equation (4.20) as\n\n\\[\nn_i = N_c \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(E_c - E_{Fi})}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nso that the thermal-equilibrium electron concentration can be written as\n\n\\[\nn_0 = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.39)\n\nSimilarly, if we add and subtract an intrinsic Fermi energy in the exponent of Equation (4.19), we will obtain\n\n\\[\np_0 = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_F - E_{Fi})}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.40)\n\nAs we will see, the Fermi level changes when donors and acceptors are added, but Equations (4.39) and (4.40) show that, as the Fermi level changes from the intrinsic Fermi level, \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) change from the \\( n_i \\) value. If \\( E_F > E_{Fi} \\), then we will have \\( n_0 > n_i \\) and \\( p_0 < n_i \\). One characteristic of an n-type semiconductor is that \\( E_F > E_{Fi} \\) so that \\( n_0 > p_0 \\). Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, \\( E_F < E_{Fi} \\) so that \\( p_0 > n_i \\) and \\( p_0 < n_i \\); thus, \\( p_0 > n_0 \\).\n\nWe can see the functional dependence of \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) with \\( E_F \\) in Figures 4.8 and 4.9. As \\( E_F \\) moves above or below \\( E_{Fi} \\), the overlapping probability function with the density of states functions in the conduction band and valence band changes. As \\( E_F \\) moves above \\( E_{Fi} \\), the probability function in the conduction band increases, while the probability, \\( 1 - f_F(E) \\), of an empty state (hole) in the valence band decreases. As \\( E_F \\) moves below \\( E_{Fi} \\), the opposite occurs.\n\n### 4.3.2 The \\( n_0 p_0 \\) Product\n\nWe may take the product of the general expressions for \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) as given in Equations (4.11) and (4.19), respectively. The result is\n\n\\[\nn_0 p_0 = N_c N_v \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT} \\right) \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.41)\n\nwhich may be written as\n\n\\[\nn_0 p_0 = N_c N_v \\exp \\left( \\frac{-E_g}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.42)\n\nAs Equation (4.42) was derived for a general value of Fermi energy, the values of \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) are not necessarily equal. However, Equation (4.42) is exactly the same as Equation (4.23), which we derived for the case of an intrinsic semiconductor. We then have that, for the semiconductor in thermal equilibrium,\n\n\\[\nn_0 p_0 = n_i^2\n\\]\n\n(4.43)\n\nEquation (4.43) states that the product of \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) is always a constant for a given semiconductor material at a given temperature. Although this equation seems\n\n\nvery simple. It is one of the fundamental principles of semiconductors in thermal equilibrium. The significance of this relation will become more apparent in the chapters that follow. It is important to keep in mind that Equation (4.43) was derived using the Boltzmann approximation. If the Boltzmann approximation is not valid, then likewise, Equation (4.43) is not valid.\n\nAn extrinsic semiconductor in thermal equilibrium does not, strictly speaking, contain an intrinsic carrier concentration, although some thermally generated carriers are present. The intrinsic electron and hole carrier concentrations are modified by the donor or acceptor impurities. However, we may think of the intrinsic concentration \\( n_i \\) in Equation (4.43) simply as a parameter of the semiconductor material.\n\n### 4.3.3 The Fermi–Dirac Integral\n\nIn the derivation of the Equations (4.11) and (4.19) for the thermal equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, we assumed that the Boltzmann approximation was valid. If the Boltzmann approximation does not hold, the thermal equilibrium electron concentration is written from Equation (4.43) as\n\n\\[\nn_0 = \\frac{4 \\pi}{h^3} (2m_n^*)^{3/2} \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} \\frac{(E - E_c)^{1/2} \\, dE}{1 + \\exp \\left( \\frac{E - E_f}{kT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(4.44)\n\nIf we again make a change of variable and let\n\n\\[\n\\eta = \\frac{E - E_c}{kT}\n\\]\n\n(4.45a)\n\nand also define\n\n\\[\n\\eta_f = \\frac{E_f - E_c}{kT}\n\\]\n\n(4.45b)\n\nthen we can rewrite Equation (4.44) as\n\n\\[\nn_0 = 4 \\pi \\left( \\frac{2m_n^* kT}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\eta^{1/2} \\, d\\eta}{1 + \\exp (\\eta - \\eta_f)}\n\\]\n\n(4.46)\n\nThe integral is defined as\n\n\\[\nF_{1/2}(\\eta_f) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\eta^{1/2} \\, d\\eta}{1 + \\exp (\\eta - \\eta_f)}\n\\]\n\n(4.47)\n\nThis function, called the Fermi–Dirac integral, is a tabulated function of the variable \\( \\eta_f \\). Figure 4.10 is a plot of the Fermi–Dirac integral. Note that if \\( \\eta_f > 0 \\), then \\( E_f > E_c \\); thus, the Fermi energy is actually in the conduction band.\n\nWe may use the same general method to calculate the thermal equilibrium concentration of holes. We obtain\n\n\\[\np_0 = 4 \\left( \\frac{2m_p^* kT}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{(\\eta')^{1/2} d\\eta'}{1 + \\exp(\\eta' - \\eta_p)} \\tag{4.48}\n\\]\n\n\n**Figure 4.10** The Fermi–Dirac integral \\( F_{1/2} \\) as a function of the Fermi energy.  \n*(From Sze [14].)*\n\n\\[\nF_{1/2}(\\eta_F) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\eta^{1/2} d\\eta}{1 + \\exp(\\eta - \\eta_F)}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\eta' = \\frac{E_c - E}{kT}\n\\]\n\n(4.49a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\eta'_F = \\frac{E_c - E_F}{kT}\n\\]\n\n(4.49b)\n\nThe integral in Equation (4.48) is the same Fermi–Dirac integral defined by Equation (4.47), although the variables have slightly different definitions. We may note that if \\(\\eta'_F > 0\\), then the Fermi level is in the valence band.\n\n### 4.3.4 Degenerate and Nondegenerate Semiconductors\n\nIn our discussion of adding dopant atoms to a semiconductor, we have implicitly assumed that the concentration of dopant atoms added is small when compared to the density of host or semiconductor atoms. The small number of impurity atoms are spread far enough apart so that there is no interaction between donor electrons, for example, in an n-type material. We have assumed that the impurities introduce discrete, noninteracting donor energy states in the n-type semiconductor and discrete, noninteracting acceptor states in the p-type semiconductor. These types of semiconductors are referred to as nondegenerate semiconductors.\n\nIf the impurity concentration increases, the distance between the impurity atoms decreases and a point will be reached when donor electrons, for example, will begin to interact with each other. When this occurs, the single discrete donor energy will split into a band of energies. As the donor concentration further increases, the band of donor states widens and may overlap the bottom of the conduction band. This overlap occurs when the donor concentration becomes comparable with the effective density of states. When the concentration of electrons in the conduction band exceeds the density of states \\(N_c\\), the Fermi energy lies within the conduction band. This type of semiconductor is called a degenerate n-type semiconductor.\n\nIn a similar way, as the acceptor doping concentration increases in a p-type semiconductor, the discrete acceptor energy states will split into a band of energies and may overlap the top of the valence band. The Fermi energy will lie in the valence band when the concentration of holes exceeds the density of states \\(N_v\\). This type of semiconductor is called a degenerate p-type semiconductor.\n\nSchematic models of the energy-band diagrams for a degenerate n-type and degenerate p-type semiconductor are shown in Figure 4.11. The energy states below \\(E_F\\)\n\n\n**Figure 4.11** | Simplified energy-band diagrams for degenerately doped (a) n-type and (b) p-type semiconductors.\n\nare mostly filled with electrons and the energy states above \\( E_F \\) are mostly empty. In the degenerate n-type semiconductor, the states between \\( E_F \\) and \\( E_c \\) are mostly filled with electrons; thus, the electron concentration in the conduction band is very large. Similarly, in the degenerate p-type semiconductor, the energy states between \\( E_v \\) and \\( E_F \\) are mostly empty; thus, the hole concentration in the valence band is very large.",

    "text": "## 4.4 Statistics of Donors and Acceptors\n\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed the Fermi–Dirac distribution function, which gives the probability that a particular energy state will be occupied by an electron. We need to reconsider this function and apply the probability statistics to the donor and acceptor energy states.\n\n### 4.4.1 Probability Function\n\nOne postulate used in the derivation of the Fermi–Dirac probability function was the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that only one particle is permitted in each quantum state. The Pauli exclusion principle also applies to the donor and acceptor states.\n\nSuppose we have \\( N_d \\) electrons and \\( g_i \\) quantum states, where the subscript \\( i \\) indicates the \\( i \\)th energy level. There are \\( g_i \\) ways of choosing where to put the first particle. Each donor level has two possible spin orientations for the donor electron; thus, each donor level has two quantum states. The insertion of an electron into one quantum state, however, precludes putting an electron into the second quantum state. By adding one electron, the vacancy requirement of the atom is satisfied, and the addition of a second electron in the donor level is not possible. The distribution function of donor electrons in the donor energy states is then slightly different than the Fermi–Dirac function.\n\nThe probability function of electrons occupying the donor state is\n\n\\[\nn_d = \\frac{N_d}{1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_d - E_F}{kT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(4.50)\n\nwhere \\( n_d \\) is the density of electrons occupying the donor level and \\( E_d \\) is the energy of the donor level. The factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in this equation is a direct result of the spin factor just mentioned. The \\(\\frac{1}{g}\\) factor is sometimes written as \\(1/g\\), where \\(g\\) is called a degeneracy factor.\n\nEquation (4.50) can also be written in the form\n\n\\[\nn_d = N_d - N_d^+\n\\]\n\n(4.51)\n\nwhere \\( N_d^+ \\) is the concentration of ionized donors. In many applications, we will be interested more in the concentration of ionized donors than in the concentration of electrons remaining in the donor states.\n\nIf we do the same type of analysis for acceptor atoms, we obtain the expression\n\n\\[\np_a = \\frac{N_a}{1 + \\frac{1}{g} \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_F - E_a}{kT} \\right)} = N_a - N_a^-\n\\]\n\n(4.52)\n\nwhere \\( N_a \\) is the concentration of acceptor atoms, \\( E_a \\) is the acceptor energy level, \\( p_a \\) is the concentration of holes in the acceptor states, and \\( N_a^- \\) is the concentration of ionized acceptors. A hole in an acceptor state corresponds to an acceptor atom that is neutrally charged and still has an “empty” bonding position as we have discussed in Section 4.2.1. The parameter \\( g \\) is, again, a degeneracy factor. The ground state degeneracy factor \\( g \\) is normally taken as 4 for the acceptor level in silicon and gallium arsenide because of the detailed band structure.\n\n### 4.4.2 Complete Ionization and Freeze-Out\n\nThe probability function for electrons in the donor energy state was just given by Equation (4.50). If we assume that \\((E_d - E_F) \\gg kT\\) then\n\n\\[\nn_d \\approx \\frac{N_d}{2} \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_d - E_F}{kT} \\right) = 2N_d \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_d - E_F)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.53)\n\nIf \\((E_d - E_F) \\gg kT\\), then the Boltzmann approximation is also valid for the electrons in the conduction band so that, from Equation (4.11),\n\n\\[\nn_0 = N_c \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWe can determine the relative number of electrons in the donor state compared with the total number of electrons; therefore, we can consider the ratio of electrons in the donor state to the total number of electrons in the conduction band plus donor state. Using the expressions of Equations (4.53) and (4.11), we write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_d}{n_d + n_0} = \\frac{2N_d \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_d - E_F)}{kT} \\right)}{2N_d \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_d - E_F)}{kT} \\right) + N_c \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(4.54)\n\n\nThe Fermi energy cancels out of this expression. Dividing by the numerator term, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_d}{n_u + n_0} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{N_c}{2N_D} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_d)}{kT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(4.55)\n\nThe factor \\((E_c - E_d)\\) is just the ionization energy of the donor electrons.\n\nAt room temperature, then, the donor states are essentially completely ionized and, for a typical doping of \\( 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\), almost all donor impurity atoms have donated an electron to the conduction band.\n\nAt room temperature, there is also essentially complete ionization of the acceptor atoms. This means that each acceptor atom has accepted an electron from the valence band so that \\( p_a \\) is zero. At typical acceptor doping concentrations, a hole is created in the valence band for each acceptor atom. This ionization effect and the creation of electrons and holes in the conduction band and valence band, respectively, are shown in Figure 4.12.\n\nThe opposite of complete ionization occurs at \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\). At absolute zero degrees, all electrons are in their lowest possible energy state; that is, for an n-type semiconductor, each donor state must contain an electron, therefore \\( n_d = N_d \\) or \\( N_d - n_d = 0 \\). We must have, then, from Equation (4.50) that \\(\\exp \\left[ \\frac{(E_d - E_f)}{kT} \\right] = 0\\). Since \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\), this will occur for \\(\\exp(-\\infty) = 0\\), which means that \\( E_f > E_d \\). The Fermi energy level must be above the donor energy level at absolute zero. In the case of a p-type semiconductor at absolute zero temperature, the impurity atoms will not contain any electrons, so that the Fermi energy level must be below the acceptor energy state. The distribution of electrons among the various energy states, and hence the Fermi energy, is a function of temperature.\n\n**Figure 4.12** Energy-band diagrams showing complete ionization of (a) donor states and (b) acceptor states.\n\n**Figure 4.13** Energy-band diagram at \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\) for (a) n-type and (b) p-type semiconductors.\n\nA detailed analysis, not given in this text, shows that at \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\), the Fermi energy is halfway between \\( E_c \\) and \\( E_d \\) for the n-type material and halfway between \\( E_a \\) and \\( E_v \\) for the p-type material. Figure 4.13 shows these effects. No electrons from the donor state are thermally elevated into the conduction band; this effect is called freeze-out. Similarly, when no electrons from the valence band are elevated into the acceptor states, the effect is also called freeze-out.\n\nBetween \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\), freeze-out, and \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\), complete ionization, we have partial ionization of donor or acceptor atoms.",

    "text": "## 4.5 | CHARGE NEUTRALITY\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, the semiconductor crystal is electrically neutral. The electrons are distributed among the various energy states, creating negative and positive charges, but the net charge density is zero. This charge-neutrality condition is used to determine the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations as a function of the impurity doping concentration. We will define a compensated semiconductor and then determine the electron and hole concentrations as a function of the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n\n### 4.5.1 Compensated Semiconductors\n\nA **compensated semiconductor** is one that contains both donor and acceptor impurity atoms in the same region. A compensated semiconductor can be formed, for example, by diffusing acceptor impurities into an n-type material or by diffusing donor impurities into a p-type material. An n-type compensated semiconductor occurs when \\( N_d > N_a \\), and a p-type compensated semiconductor occurs when \\( N_a > N_d \\). If \\( N_d = N_a \\), we have a completely compensated semiconductor that has, as we will show, the characteristics of an intrinsic material. Compensated semiconductors are created quite naturally during device fabrication as we will see later.\n\n### 4.5.2 Equilibrium Electron and Hole Concentrations\n\n!Energy-band diagram of a compensated semiconductor\n\n**Figure 4.14** Energy-band diagram of a compensated semiconductor showing ionized and un-ionized donors and acceptors.\n\nFigure 4.14 shows the energy-band diagram of a semiconductor when both donor and acceptor impurity atoms are added to the same region to form a compensated semiconductor. The figure shows how the electrons and holes can be distributed among the various states.\n\nThe charge neutrality condition is expressed by equating the density of negative charges to the density of positive charges. We then have\n\n\\[\nn_0 + N_D^+ = p_0 + N_A^-\n\\]\n\n(4.56)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nn_0 + (N_D - n_d) = p_0 + (N_A - n_a)\n\\]\n\n(4.57)\n\nwhere \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) are the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. The parameter \\( n_d \\) is the concentration of electrons in the donor energy states, so \\( N_D^+ = N_D - n_d \\) is the concentration of positively charged donor states. Similarly, \\( p_a \\) is the concentration of holes in the acceptor states, so \\( N_A^- = N_A - p_a \\) is the concentration of negatively charged acceptor states. We have expressions for \\( n_0, p_0, n_d, \\) and \\( p_a \\) in terms of the Fermi energy and temperature.\n\n\n**Thermal-Equilibrium Electron Concentration**\n\nIf we assume complete ionization, \\( n_d \\) and \\( p_a \\) are both zero, and Equation (4.57) becomes:\n\n\\[\nn_0 + N_a = p_0 + \\frac{n_i^2}{n_0} = N_d\n\\]\n\n(4.58)\n\nIf we express \\( p_0 \\) as \\( n_i^2/n_0 \\), then Equation (4.58) can be written as:\n\n\\[\nn_0 + N_a = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_0} + N_d\n\\]\n\n(4.59a)\n\nwhich in turn can be written as:\n\n\\[\nn_0^2 = (N_d - N_a)n_0 - n_i^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n(4.59b)\n\nThe electron concentration \\( n_0 \\) can be determined using the quadratic formula, or:\n\n\\[\nn_0 = \\frac{(N_d - N_a)}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_d - N_a}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}\n\\]\n\n(4.60)\n\nThe **positive sign** in the quadratic formula must be used, since, in the limit of an intrinsic semiconductor when \\( N_d = N_a = 0 \\), the electron concentration must be a positive quantity, or \\( n_0 = n_i \\).\n\nEquation (4.60) is used to calculate the electron concentration in an n-type semiconductor, or when \\( N_d > N_a \\). Although Equation (4.60) was derived for a compensated semiconductor, the equation is also valid for \\( N_a = 0 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{[} q \\cdot \\text{(} w_s \\cdot s)01 \\times y = w \\cdot (q) \\cdot i_w \\cdot \\Sigma \\text{]} = q \\cdot t_w \\cdot (w_s)01 \\times y = w \\cdot (y) \\cdot stv \\text{]}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe have argued in our discussion and we may note from the results of Example 4.9 that the concentration of electrons in the conduction band increases above the intrinsic carrier concentration as we add donor impurity atoms. At the same time, the minority carrier hole concentration decreases below the intrinsic carrier concentration as we add donor atoms. We must keep in mind that as we add donor impurity atoms and the corresponding donor electrons, there is a redistribution of electrons among available energy states. Figure 4.15 shows a schematic of this physical redistribution. A few of the donor electrons will fall into the empty states in the valence band and, in doing so, will annihilate some of the intrinsic holes. The minority carrier hole concentration will therefore decrease as we have seen in Example 4.9. At the same time, because of this redistribution, the net electron concentration in the conduction band is not simply equal to the donor concentration plus the intrinsic electron concentration.\n\n\n**Figure 4.15** | Energy-band diagram showing the redistribution of electrons when donors are added.\n\nWe have seen that the intrinsic carrier concentration \\( n_i \\) is a very strong function of temperature. As the temperature increases, additional electron-hole pairs are thermally generated so that the \\( n_i^2 \\) term in Equation (4.60) may begin to dominate. The semiconductor will eventually lose its extrinsic characteristics. Figure 4.16 shows the electron concentration versus temperature in silicon doped with \\( 5 \\times 10^{14} \\) donors per cm\\(^3\\). As the temperature increases, we can see where the intrinsic concentration begins to dominate. Also shown is the partial ionization, or the onset of freeze-out, at the low temperature.\n\n**Thermal-Equilibrium Hole Concentration**\n\nIf we reconsider Equation (4.58) and express \\( n_i^2/p_0 \\), then we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_i^2}{p_0} + N_D = p_0 + N_A \\tag{4.61a}\n\\]\n\nwhich we can write as\n\n\\[\np_0^2 - (N_A - N_D)p_0 - n_i^2 = 0 \\tag{4.61b}\n\\]\n\n**Figure 4.16** Electron concentration versus temperature showing the three regions: partial ionization, extrinsic, and intrinsic.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, the hole concentration is given by\n\n\\[\np_0 = \\frac{N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}\n\\]\n\n(4.62)\n\nwhere the positive sign, again, must be used. Equation (4.62) is used to calculate the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier hole concentration in a p-type semiconductor, or when \\(N_A > N_D\\).

The minority carrier hole concentration in an n-type semiconductor could, theoretically, be calculated from Equation (4.62). However, we would be subtracting two numbers on the order of \\( 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\), for example, to obtain a number on the order of \\( 10^4 \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\), which from a practical point of view is not possible. The minority carrier concentrations are calculated from \\( n_0p_0 = n_i^2 \\) once the majority carrier concentration has been determined.",

    "text": "## 4.6 | POSITION OF FERMI ENERGY LEVEL\n\nWe have discussed qualitatively in Section 4.3.1 how the electron and hole concentrations change as the Fermi energy level moves through the bandgap energy. Then, in Section 4.5, we calculated the electron and hole concentrations as a function of donor and acceptor impurity concentrations. We can now determine the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the doping concentrations and as a function of temperature. The relevance of the Fermi energy level will be further discussed after the mathematical derivations.\n\n### 4.6.1 Mathematical Derivation\n\nThe position of the Fermi energy level within the bandgap can be determined by using the equations already developed for the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations. **If we assume the Boltzmann approximation to be valid**, then from Equation (4.11) we have \\( n_0 = N_c \\exp \\left[ \\frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT} \\right] \\). We can solve for \\( E_c - E_F \\) from this equation and obtain\n\n\\[\nE_c - E_F = kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_c}{n_0} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.63)\n\nwhere \\( n_0 \\) is given by Equation (4.60). If we consider an n-type semiconductor in which \\( N_D \\gg p_0 \\), then \\( n_0 \\approx N_D \\), so that\n\n\\[\nE_c - E_F = kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_c}{N_D} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.64)\n\nThe distance between the bottom of the conduction band and the Fermi energy is a logarithmic function of the donor concentration. As the donor concentration increases, the Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band. Conversely, if the Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band, then the electron concentration in the conduction band is increasing. We may note that if we have a compensated semiconductor, then the \\( N_D \\) term in Equation (4.64) is simply replaced by \\( N_D - N_A \\), or the net effective donor concentration.\n\nWe may develop a slightly different expression for the position of the Fermi level. We had from Equation (4.39) that \\( n_0 = n_i \\exp \\left[ \\frac{(E_F - E_i)}{kT} \\right] \\). We can solve for \\( E_F - E_i \\) as\n\n\\[\nE_F - E_i = kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{n_0}{n_i} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.65)\n\nEquation (4.65) can be used specifically for an n-type semiconductor, where \\( n_0 \\) is given by Equation (4.60), to find the difference between the Fermi level and the intrinsic Fermi level as a function of the donor concentration. We may note that, if the net effective donor concentration is zero, that is, \\( N_D - N_A = 0 \\), then \\( n_0 = n_i \\) and \\( E_F = E_i \\). A completely compensated semiconductor has the characteristics of an intrinsic material in terms of carrier concentration and Fermi-level position.\n\nWe can derive the same types of equations for a p-type semiconductor. From Equation (4.19), we have \\( p_0 = N_A \\exp \\left[ \\frac{-(E_F - E_v)}{kT} \\right] \\), so that\n\n\\[\nE_F - E_v = kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_v}{p_0} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.66)\n\nIf we assume that \\( N_A \\gg n_i \\), then Equation (4.66) can be written as\n\n\\[\nE_F - E_v = kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_v}{N_A} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.67)\n\nThe distance between the Fermi level and the top of the valence-band energy for a p-type semiconductor is a logarithmic function of the acceptor concentration: as the acceptor concentration increases, the Fermi level moves closer to the valence band. Equation (4.67) still assumes that the Boltzmann approximation is valid. Again, if we have a compensated p-type semiconductor, then the \\( N_A \\) term in Equation (4.67) is replaced by \\( N_A - N_D \\) or the net effective acceptor concentration.\n\nWe can also derive an expression for the relationship between the Fermi level and the intrinsic Fermi level in terms of the hole concentration. We have from Equation (4.40) that \\( p_0 = n_i \\exp \\left[ \\frac{-(E_F - E_i)}{kT} \\right] \\), which yields\n\n\\[\nE_F - E_i = kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{p_0}{n_i} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(4.68)\n\nEquation (4.68) can be used to find the difference between the intrinsic Fermi level and the Fermi energy in terms of the acceptor concentration. The hole concentration \\( p_0 \\) in Equation (4.68) is given by Equation (4.62).\n\n**Figure 4.17** | Position of Fermi level for an (a) n-type \\((N_D > N_A)\\) and (b) p-type \\((N_A > N_D)\\) semiconductor.\n\nWe may again note from Equation (4.65) that, for an n-type semiconductor, \\(n_0 > p_0\\) and \\(E_F > E_Fi\\). The Fermi level for an n-type semiconductor is above \\(E_Fi\\). For a p-type semiconductor, \\(p_0 > n_0\\), and from Equation (4.68) we see that \\(E_Fi > E_F\\). The Fermi level for a p-type semiconductor is below \\(E_Fi\\). These results are shown in Figure 4.17.\n\n### 4.6.2 Variation of \\(E_F\\) with Doping Concentration and Temperature\n\nWe may plot the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the doping concentration. **Figure 4.18** shows the Fermi energy level as a function of donor concentration (n-type) and as a function of acceptor concentration (p-type) for silicon at \\(T = 300 \\, K\\). As the doping levels increase, the Fermi energy level moves closer to the conduction band for the n-type material and closer to the valence band for the p-type material. Keep in mind that the equations for the Fermi energy level that we have derived assume that the Boltzmann approximation is valid.\n\n**Figure 4.18** | Position of Fermi level as a function of donor concentration (n-type) and acceptor concentration (p-type).\n\n| \\(N_D \\, (\\text{cm}^{-3})\\) | \\(N_A \\, (\\text{cm}^{-3})\\) |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| \\(10^{12}\\)                 | \\(10^{12}\\)                 |\n| \\(10^{13}\\)                 | \\(10^{13}\\)                 |\n| \\(10^{14}\\)                 | \\(10^{14}\\)                 |\n| \\(10^{15}\\)                 | \\(10^{15}\\)                 |\n| \\(10^{16}\\)                 | \\(10^{16}\\)                 |\n| \\(10^{17}\\)                 | \\(10^{17}\\)                 |\n| \\(10^{18}\\)                 | \\(10^{18}\\)                 |\n\n- **n-type**: Fermi level moves closer to \\(E_c\\).\n- **p-type**: Fermi level moves closer to \\(E_v\\).\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration, \\( n_i \\), in Equations (4.65) and (4.68), is a strong function of temperature, so that \\( E_F \\) is a function of temperature also. Figure 4.19 shows the variation of the Fermi energy level in silicon with temperature for several donor and acceptor concentrations. As the temperature increases, \\( n_i \\) increases, and \\( E_F \\) moves closer to the intrinsic Fermi level. At high temperature, the semiconductor material begins to lose its extrinsic characteristics and begins to behave more like an intrinsic semiconductor. At the very low temperature, freeze-out occurs; the Boltzmann approximation is no longer valid and the equations we derived for the Fermi-level position no longer apply. At the low temperature where freeze-out occurs, the Fermi level goes above \\( E_F \\) for the n-type material and below \\( E_F \\) for the p-type material. At absolute zero degrees, all energy states below \\( E_F \\) are full and all energy states above \\( E_F \\) are empty.\n\n### 4.6.3 Relevance of the Fermi Energy\n\nWe have been calculating the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of doping concentrations and temperature. This analysis may seem somewhat arbitrary and fictitious. However, these relations do become significant later in our discussion of pn junctions and the other semiconductor devices we consider. An important...\n\n**Figure 4.19** Position of Fermi level as a function of temperature for various doping concentrations.  \n*(From Sze [14].)*\n\nThe point is that, in thermal equilibrium, the Fermi energy level is a constant throughout a system. We will not prove this statement, but we can intuitively see its validity by considering the following example.\n\nSuppose we have a particular material, A, whose electrons are distributed in the energy states of an allowed band as shown in Figure 4.20a. Most of the energy states below \\( E_F \\) contain electrons and most of the energy states above \\( E_F \\) are empty of electrons. Consider another material, B, whose electrons are distributed in the energy states of an allowed band as shown in Figure 4.20b. The energy states below \\( E_F \\) are mostly full and the energy states above \\( E_F \\) are mostly empty. If these two materials are brought into intimate contact, the electrons in the entire system will tend to seek the lowest possible energy. Electrons from material A will flow into the lower energy states of material B, as indicated in Figure 4.20c, until thermal equilibrium is reached. Thermal equilibrium occurs when the distribution of electrons, as a function of energy, is the same in the two materials. This equilibrium state occurs when the Fermi energy is the same in the two materials as shown in Figure 4.20d. The Fermi energy, important in the physics of the semiconductor, also provides a good pictorial representation of the characteristics of the semiconductor materials and devices.\n\n**Figure 4.20** The Fermi energy of (a) material A in thermal equilibrium, (b) material B in thermal equilibrium, (c) materials A and B at the instant they are placed in contact, and (d) materials A and B in contact at thermal equilibrium.",

    "text": "## 11.1 Nonideal Effects\n\nAs with any semiconductor device, the experimental characteristics of MOSFETs deviate to some degree from the ideal relations that have been theoretically derived using the various assumptions and approximations. In this section, we consider five effects that cause deviations from the assumptions used in the ideal derivations. These effects are subthreshold conduction, channel length modulation, mobility variations, velocity saturation, and ballistic transport.\n\n### 11.1.1 Subthreshold Conduction\n\nThe ideal current–voltage relationship predicts zero drain current when the gate-to-source voltage is less than or equal to the threshold voltage. Experimentally, \\( I_D \\) is not zero when \\( V_{GS} \\leq V_T \\). Figure 11.1 shows a comparison between the ideal characteristic that was derived, and the experimental results. The drain current, which exists for \\( V_{GS} \\leq V_T \\), is known as the **subthreshold current**.\n\nFigure 11.2 shows the energy-band diagram of an MOS structure with a p-type substrate biased so that \\( \\phi_s < 2\\phi_B \\). At the same time, the Fermi level is closer to the conduction band than the valence band, so the semiconductor surface develops the\n\n**Figure 11.1** Comparison of ideal and experimental plots of \\( \\sqrt{I_D} \\) versus \\( V_{GS} \\).\n\n**Figure 11.2** Energy-band diagram when \\( \\phi_s < \\phi_F < 2\\phi_B \\).\n\n**Figure 11.3** (a) Cross section along channel length of n-channel MOSFET. Energy-band diagrams along channel length at (b) accumulation, (c) weak inversion, and (d) inversion.\n\nCharacteristics of a lightly doped n-type material. We would expect, then, to observe some conduction between the n\\(^+\\) source and drain contacts through this weakly inverted channel. The condition for \\(\\phi_p < \\phi_s < 2\\phi_p\\) is known as **weak inversion**.\n\nFigure 11.3 shows the surface potential along the length of the channel at accumulation, weak inversion, and threshold for the case when a small drain voltage is applied. The bulk p-substrate is assumed to be at zero potential. Figure 11.3b, c shows the accumulation and weak inversion cases. There is a potential barrier between the n\\(^+\\) source and channel region which the electrons must overcome in order to generate a channel current. A comparison of these barriers with those in pn junctions would suggest that the channel current is an exponential function of \\(V_{GS}\\). In the inversion mode, shown in Figure 11.3d, the barrier is so small that we lose the exponential dependence, since the junction is more like an ohmic contact.\n\nThe actual derivation of the subthreshold current is beyond the scope of this chapter. We can write that\n\n\\[\nI_D(\\text{sub}) \\propto \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{GS}}{kT}\\right) \\right] \\cdot \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{-eV_{DS}}{kT}\\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(11.1)\n\nIf \\(V_{DS}\\) is larger than a few \\((kT/e)\\) volts, then the subthreshold current is independent of \\(V_{DS}\\).\n\nFigure 11.4 shows the exponential behavior of the subthreshold current for several body-to-source voltages. Also shown on the curves are the threshold voltage values. Ideally, a change in gate voltage on approximately 60 mV produces an order of magnitude change in the subthreshold current. A detailed analysis of the subthreshold condition shows that the slope of the \\(I_D\\) versus \\(V_{GS}\\) curve is a function of the semiconductor doping and is also a function of the interface state density. The measurement of the slope of these curves has been used to experimentally determine the oxide–semiconductor interface state density.\n\n**Figure 11.4** | Subthreshold current–voltage characteristics for several values of substrate voltage (the threshold voltage is indicated on each curve).  \n(From Schroder [17].)\n\nIf a MOSFET is biased at or even slightly below the threshold voltage, the drain current is not zero. The subthreshold current may add significantly to power dissipation in a large-scale integrated circuit in which hundreds or thousands of MOSFETs are used. The circuit design must include the subthreshold current or ensure that the MOSFET is biased sufficiently below the threshold voltage in the “off” state.\n\n### 11.1.2 Channel Length Modulation\n\nWe assumed in the derivation of the ideal current–voltage relationship that the channel length \\( L \\) was a constant. However, when the MOSFET is biased in the saturation region, the depletion region at the drain terminal extends laterally into the channel, reducing the effective channel length. Since the depletion region width is bias dependent, the effective channel length is also bias dependent and is modulated by the drain-to-source voltage. This channel length modulation effect is shown in Figure 11.15 for an n-channel MOSFET.\n\nThe depletion width extending into the p-region of a p-n junction under zero bias can be written as\n\n\\[\nx_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon \\phi_{ir}}{e N_a}}\n\\]\n\n(11.2)\n\n**Figure 11.5** | Cross-section of an n-channel MOSFET showing the channel length modulation effect.\n\nFor a one-sided n\\(^+\\)p junction, essentially all of the applied reverse-biased voltage is across the low-doped p region. The space charge width of the drain–substrate junction is approximately\n\n\\[\nx_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s}{eN_A}(\\phi_{bp} + V_{DS})}\n\\]\n\n(11.3)\n\nHowever, the space charge region defined by \\(\\Delta L\\), as shown in Figure 11.5, does not begin to form until \\(V_{DS} > V_{DS(sat)}\\). As a first approximation, we can write that \\(\\Delta L\\) is the total space charge width minus the space charge width that exists when \\(V_{DS} = V_{DS(sat)}\\), or\n\n\\[\n\\Delta L = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s}{eN_A} \\left[ \\phi_{bp} + V_{DS(sat)} + \\Delta V_{DS} - \\sqrt{\\phi_{bp} + V_{DS(sat)}} \\right]}\n\\]\n\n(11.4)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V_{DS} = V_{DS} - V_{DS(sat)}\n\\]\n\n(11.5)\n\nThe applied drain-to-source voltage is \\(V_{DS}\\) and we are assuming that \\(V_{DS} > V_{DS(sat)}\\).\n\nAs a second approximation at determining \\(\\Delta L\\), we can consider Figure 11.6 and revisit the one-dimensional Poisson’s equation. The electric field \\(E_{sat}\\) is the lateral electric field at the point where the inversion layer charge is pinched off. Neglecting any charges that exist due to current, we can write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(11.6)\n\nwhere \\(\\rho(x) = -eN_A\\), and is a constant for a uniformly doped substrate. Integrating Equation (11.6) and applying the boundary conditions give the electric field in the space charge region defined by \\(\\Delta L\\):\n\n\\[\nE = -\\frac{eN_Ax}{\\varepsilon_s} - E_{sat}\n\\]\n\n(11.7)\n\n**Figure 11.6** Expanded view of cross section near the drain terminal of an n-channel MOSFET showing the channel length modulation effect.\n\nThe potential in this region is\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = -\\int E \\, dx = \\frac{eN_s x^2}{2\\epsilon} + E_{\\text{sat}} x + C_1\n\\]\n\n(11.8)\n\nwhere \\( C_1 \\) is a constant of integration. The boundary conditions are \\(\\phi(x = 0) = V_{DS(\\text{sat})}\\) and \\(\\phi(x = \\Delta L) = V_{DS}\\). Substituting these boundary conditions into Equation (11.8), we obtain\n\n\\[\nV_{DS} = \\frac{eN_s (\\Delta L)^2}{2\\epsilon} + E_{\\text{sat}} (\\Delta L) + V_{DS(\\text{sat})}\n\\]\n\n(11.9)\n\nSolving for \\(\\Delta L\\), we can write\n\n\\[\n\\Delta L = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{eN_s} \\left[ \\sqrt{\\phi_{\\text{sat}} + [V_{DS} - V_{DS(\\text{sat})}]} - \\sqrt{\\phi_{\\text{sat}}} \\right]}\n\\]\n\n(11.10)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{\\text{sat}} = \\frac{2\\epsilon}{eN_s} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{E_{\\text{sat}}}{2} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nIn general, the value of \\( E_{\\text{sat}} \\) is in the range \\( 10^4 < E_{\\text{sat}} < 2 \\times 10^5 \\) V/cm.\n\nOther models used to determine \\(\\Delta L\\) include the negative charges due to the drain current and also include two-dimensional effects. These models are not considered here.\n\nSince the drain current is inversely proportional to the channel length, we may write\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\left[ \\frac{L}{L - \\Delta L} \\right] I_{D0}\n\\]\n\n(11.11)\n\nwhere \\( I_D \\) is the actual drain current and \\( I_{D0} \\) is the ideal drain current. Since \\(\\Delta L\\) is a function of \\( V_{DS} \\), \\( I_D \\) is now also a function of \\( V_{DS} \\) even though the transistor is biased in the saturation region.\n\n**Figure 11.7** Current–voltage characteristics of a MOSFET showing short-channel effects. (From See [22].)\n\nSince \\( I_D \\) is now a function of \\( V_{DS} \\), the output resistance is no longer infinite. The drain current in the saturation region can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{k'}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot \\left[(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 (1 + \\lambda V_{DS})\\right]\n\\]\n\n(11.12)\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the **channel length modulation parameter**.\n\nThe output resistance is given by\n\n\\[\nr_o = \\left( \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\right)^{-1} = \\left[ \\frac{k'}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\cdot \\lambda \\right]^{-1}\n\\]\n\n(11.13a)\n\nSince \\(\\lambda\\) is normally small, Equation (11.13a) can be written as\n\n\\[\nr_o \\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda I_D}\n\\]\n\n(11.13b)\n\nFigure 11.7 shows some typical \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curves with positive slopes in the saturation region due to channel length modulation. As the MOSFET dimensions become smaller, the change in the channel length \\(\\Delta L\\) becomes a larger fraction of the original length \\(L\\), and the channel length modulation becomes more severe.\n\n### 11.1.3 Mobility Variation\n\nIn the derivation of the ideal \\( I-V \\) relationship, we explicitly assumed that the mobility was a constant. However, this assumption must be modified for two reasons. The first effect to be considered is the variation in mobility with gate voltage. The second reason for a mobility variation is that the effective carrier mobility decreases as the carrier approaches the velocity saturation limit. This effect is discussed in the next section.\n\nThe inversion layer charge is induced by a vertical electric field, which is shown in Figure 11.8 for an n-channel device. A positive gate voltage produces a force on the electrons in the inversion layer toward the surface. As the electrons travel through the channel toward the drain, they are attracted to the surface, but then are repelled by localized coulombic forces. This effect, schematically shown in Figure 11.9, is called **surface scattering**. The surface scattering effect reduces mobility. If there is a positive fixed oxide charge near the oxide-semiconductor interface, the mobility will be further reduced due to the additional coulomb interaction.\n\n**Figure 11.8** Vertical electric field in an n-channel MOSFET.\n\n**Figure 11.9** Schematic of carrier surface scattering effects.\n\nThe relationship between the inversion charge mobility and the transverse electric field is usually measured experimentally. An effective transverse electric field can be defined as\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_s} \\left( |Q_{D} \\, (\\text{max})| + \\frac{1}{2} |Q_{I}| \\right)\n\\]\n\n(11.14)\n\nThe effective inversion charge mobility can be determined from the channel conductance as a function of gate voltage. Figure 11.10 shows the effective electron mobility at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) for different doping levels and different oxide thicknesses. The effective mobility is only a function of the electric field at the inversion layer and is independent of oxide thickness. The effective mobility may be represented by\n\n\\[\n\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = \\mu_0 \\left( \\frac{E_{\\text{eff}}}{E_0} \\right)^{-1/3}\n\\]\n\n(11.15)\n\nwhere \\( \\mu_0 \\) and \\( E_0 \\) are constants determined from experimental results.\n\n**Figure 11.10** Measured inversion layer electron mobility versus electric field at the inversion layer.  \n*(From Yang [25].)*\n\n- Electron mobility (\\( \\text{cm}^2/\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s} \\)) \n- Electric field in inversion layer, \\( E_{\\text{eff}} \\) (V/cm)\n\nThe effective inversion charge mobility is a strong function of temperature because of lattice scattering. As the temperature is reduced, the mobility increases.\n\nThe effective mobility is a function of gate voltage through the inversion charge density in Equation (11.14). As the gate voltage increases, the carrier mobility decreases even further.\n\n### 11.1.4 Velocity Saturation\n\nIn the analysis of the long-channel MOSFET, we assume the mobility to be constant, which means that the drift velocity increases without limit as the electric field increases. In this ideal case, the carrier velocity increases until the ideal current is attained. However, we have seen that the carrier velocity saturates with increasing electric field. Velocity saturation will become more prominent in shorter-channel devices since the corresponding horizontal electric field is generally larger.\n\nIn the ideal I–V relationship, current saturation occurs when the inversion charge density becomes zero at the drain terminal, or when\n\n\\[\nV_{DS} = V_{DS(sat)} = V_{GS} - V_T\n\\]\n\n(11.16)\n\nfor the n-channel MOSFET. However, velocity saturation can change this saturation condition. Velocity saturation will occur when the horizontal electric field is approximately \\(10^4\\) V/cm. If \\(V_{DS} = 5\\) V in a device with a channel length of \\(L = 1 \\, \\mu m\\), the average electric field is \\(5 \\times 10^4\\) V/cm. Velocity saturation, then, is very likely to occur in short-channel devices.\n\nThe modified \\(I_D(sat)\\) characteristics are described approximately by\n\n\\[\nI_D(sat) = W C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T) v_{sat}\n\\]\n\n(11.17)\n\nwhere \\(v_{sat}\\) is the saturation velocity (approximately \\(10^7\\) cm/s for electrons in bulk silicon) and \\(C_{ox}\\) is the gate oxide capacitance per cm². The saturation velocity will decrease somewhat with applied gate voltage because of the vertical electric field and surface scattering. Velocity saturation will yield an \\(I_D(sat)\\) value smaller than that predicted by the ideal relation, and it will yield a smaller \\(V_{DS(sat)}\\) value than predicted. The \\(I_D(sat)\\) current is also approximately linear with \\(V_{GS}\\), instead of having the ideal square law dependence predicted previously.\n\nThere are several models of mobility versus electric field. One particular relation that is commonly used is\n\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{eff}}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{eff} E}{v_{sat}}\\right)^n\\right]^{1/n}}\n\\]\n\n(11.18)\n\nFigure 11.11 shows a comparison of drain current versus drain-to-source voltage characteristics for constant mobility and for field-dependent mobility. The smaller values of \\(I_D(sat)\\) and the approximate linear dependence on \\(V_{GS}\\) may be noted for the field-dependent mobility curves.\n\nThe transconductance is found from\n\n\\[\ng_m = \\frac{\\partial I_D(sat)}{\\partial V_{GS}} = W C_{ox} v_{sat}\n\\]\n\n(11.19)\n\nwhich is now independent of \\(V_{GS}\\) and \\(V_{DS}\\) when velocity saturation occurs. The drain current is saturated by the velocity saturation effect, which leads to a constant transconductance.\n\nWhen velocity saturation occurs, the cutoff frequency is given by\n\n\\[\nf_T = \\frac{g_m}{2\\pi C_G} = \\frac{W C_{ox} v_{sat}}{2\\pi (C_{ox} W L)} = \\frac{v_{sat}}{2\\pi L}\n\\]\n\n(11.20)\n\nwhere the parasitic capacitances are assumed to be negligible.\n\n### 11.1.5 Ballistic Transport\n\nScattering events in a semiconductor limit the velocity of carriers to an average drift velocity as discussed in Chapter 5. The average drift velocity is a function of the\n\n**Figure 11.11** Comparison of \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_D \\) characteristics for constant mobility (dashed curves) and for field-dependent mobility and velocity saturation effects (solid curves).  \n*(From Sze and Ng [22].)*\n\n\nMean time between collisions or the mean distance between scattering events. In the long-channel device, the channel length \\( L \\) is much longer than the mean distance between collisions \\( l \\), so that an average carrier drift velocity exists. As the MOSFET channel length is reduced, the mean distance between collisions \\( l \\) may become comparable to \\( L \\) so that the previous analysis may not be valid. If the channel length is further reduced so that \\( L < l \\), then a large fraction of carriers could travel from the source to the drain without experiencing a scattering event. This motion of carriers is called **ballistic transport**.\n\nBallistic transport means that carriers travel faster than the average drift velocity or the saturation velocity, and this effect can lead to very fast devices. Ballistic transport occurs in submicron (\\( L < 1 \\, \\mu m \\)) devices. As the MOSFET technology continues to shrink the channel length toward the 0.1 \\(\\mu m\\) value, the ballistic transport phenomenon will become more important.",

    "text": "## 11.2 MOSFET Scaling\n\nAs we noted in the previous chapter, the frequency response of MOSFETs increases as the channel length decreases. The driving force in CMOS technology evolution in the last couple of decades has been reduced channel lengths. Channel lengths of 0.13 μm or less are now the norm. One question that must be considered is what other device parameters must be scaled as the channel length is scaled down.\n\n### 11.2.1 Constant-Field Scaling\n\nThe principle of constant-field scaling is that device dimensions and device voltages be scaled such that electric fields (both horizontal and vertical) remain essentially constant. To ensure that the reliability of the scaled device is not compromised, the electric fields in the scaled device must not increase.\n\nFigure 11.12a shows the cross section and parameters of an original NMOS device and Figure 11.12b shows the scaled device, where the scaling parameter is \\( k \\). Typically, \\( k \\approx 0.7 \\) per generation of a given technology.\n\nAs seen in the figure, the channel length is scaled from \\( L \\) to \\( kL \\). To maintain a constant horizontal electric field, the drain voltage must also be scaled from \\( V_D \\) to \\( kV_D \\). The maximum gate voltage will also be scaled from \\( V_G \\) to \\( kV_G \\) so that the gate and drain voltages remain compatible. To maintain a constant vertical electric field, the oxide thickness then must also be scaled from \\( t_{\\text{ox}} \\) to \\( kt_{\\text{ox}} \\).\n\nThe maximum depletion width at the drain terminal, for a one-sided pn junction, is\n\n\\[\nx_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon (V_{dn} + V_{bi})}{eN_a}}\n\\]\n\n(11.21)\n\n\n**Figure 11.12** | Cross section of (a) original NMOS transistor and (b) scaled NMOS transistor.\n\n- **(a)** Original NMOS transistor\n  - \\( V_G \\)\n  - \\( V_D \\)\n  - \\( t_{\\text{ox}} \\)\n  - \\( L \\)\n  - \\( N_a \\) doping\n\n- **(b)** Scaled NMOS transistor\n  - \\( kV_G \\)\n  - \\( kV_D \\)\n  - \\( kt_{\\text{ox}} \\)\n  - \\( kL \\)\n  - \\( \\frac{N_a}{k} \\) doping\n\n\nTable 11.1 Summary of constant-field device scaling\n\n| Device and circuit parameters | Scaling factor (k < 1) |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Scaled parameters**         |                        |\n| Device dimensions (L, t<sub>ox</sub>, W, x) | k |\n| Doping concentration (N<sub>a</sub>, N<sub>d</sub>) | 1/k |\n| Voltages                      | k                      |\n| **Effect on device parameters** |                      |\n| Electric field                | 1                      |\n| Carrier velocity              | 1                      |\n| Depletion widths              | k                      |\n| Capacitance (C = εA/l)        | k                      |\n| Drift current                 | 1                      |\n| **Effect on circuit parameters** |                    |\n| Device density                | 1/k<sup>2</sup>        |\n| Power density                 | 1                      |\n| Power dissipation per device (P = IV) | k<sup>2</sup> |\n| Circuit delay time (≈ CV/I)   | k                      |\n| Power–delay product (Pτ)      | k<sup>2</sup>          |\n\n**Scaled parameters:**\n- **Device dimensions** (e.g., $L$, $t_{ox}$, $W$, $x_j$) scale by a factor of **$k$**.\n- **Doping concentration** (e.g., $N_a$, $N_d$) scales by a factor of **$1/k$**.\n- **Voltages** scale by a factor of **$k$**.\n\n**Effect on device parameters:**\n- **Electric field** remains unchanged, scales by a factor of **1**.\n- **Carrier velocity** remains unchanged, scales by a factor of **1**.\n- **Depletion widths** scale by a factor of **$k$**.\n- **Capacitance** ($C = \\varepsilon A / t$) scales by a factor of **$k$**.\n- **Drift current** scales by a factor of **$k$**.\n\n**Effect on circuit parameters:**\n- **Device density** scales by a factor of **$1/k^2$**.\n- **Power density** remains unchanged, scales by a factor of **1**.\n- **Power dissipation per device** ($P = IV$) scales by a factor of **$k^2$**.\n- **Circuit delay time** (approximately $CV/I$) scales by a factor of **$k$**.\n- **Power–delay product** ($P\\tau$) scales by a factor of **$k^3$**.\n\nSince the channel length is being reduced, the depletion widths also need to be reduced. If the substrate doping concentration is increased by the factor (1/k), then the depletion width is reduced by approximately the factor k since V<sub>B</sub> is reduced by k.\n\nThe drain current per channel width, for the transistor biased in the saturation region, can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{I_D}{W} = \\frac{\\mu_n \\epsilon_{ox}}{2t_{ox}L} (V_G - V_T)^2 \\rightarrow \\frac{\\mu_n \\epsilon_{ox}}{2t_{ox}(kL)} (kV_G - V_T)^2 = \\text{constant} \\quad (11.22)\n\\]\n\nThe drift current per channel width remains essentially a constant, so if the channel width is reduced by k, then the drain current is also reduced by k. The area of the device, A ≈ WL, is then reduced by k<sup>2</sup> and the power, P = IV, is also reduced by k<sup>2</sup>. The power density in the chip remains unchanged.\n\nTable 11.1 summarizes the device scaling and the effect on circuit parameters. Keep in mind that the width and length of interconnect lines are also assumed to be reduced by the same scaling factor.\n\n### 11.2.2 Threshold Voltage—First Approximation\n\nIn constant-field scaling, the device voltages are reduced by the scaling factor k. It would seem appropriate that the threshold voltage should also be scaled by the same factor. The threshold voltage, for a uniformly doped substrate, can be written as\n\n\\[\nV_T = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_p + \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_s N_a (2\\phi_p)}}{C_{ox}} \\quad (11.23)\n\\]\n\nThe first two terms in Equation (11.23) are functions of material parameters that do not scale and are only very slight functions of doping concentration. The last term is approximately proportional to \\(\\sqrt{k}\\), so the threshold voltage does not scale directly with the scaling factor k.\n\nThe effect of short channels on the threshold voltage is discussed further in section 11.3 of this chapter.\n\n### 11.2.3 Generalized Scaling\n\nIn constant-field scaling, the applied voltages are scaled with the same scaling factor \\( k \\) as the device dimensions. However, in actual technology evolution, voltages have not been reduced with the same scaling factor. There has been reluctance, for example, to change standardized power supply levels that have been used in circuits earlier. In addition, other factors that do not scale, such as threshold voltage and subthreshold currents, have made the reduction in applied voltages less desirable. As a consequence, electric fields in MOS devices have tended to increase as device dimensions shrunk.\n\nConsequences of increased electric fields are reduced reliability and increased power density. As the power density increases, the device temperature may increase. Increased temperature may affect the device reliability. As the oxide thickness is reduced and the electric field is increased, gate oxides are closer to breakdown and oxide integrity may be more difficult to maintain. In addition, direct tunneling of carriers through the oxide may be more likely to occur. Increased electric fields may also increase the chances of hot-electron effects, which are discussed later in this chapter. Reducing device dimensions, then, can introduce challenging problems that must be solved.",

    "text": "## 11.3 THRESHOLD VOLTAGE MODIFICATIONS\n\nWe have derived the ideal MOSFET relations in the previous chapter, including expressions for threshold voltage and for the current–voltage characteristics. We now consider some of the nonideal effects including channel length modulation. Additional effects on threshold voltage occur as the devices shrink in size. A reduction in channel length increases the transconductance and frequency response of the MOSFET, and a reduction in channel width increases the packing density in an integrated circuit. A reduction in either or both the channel length and channel width can affect the threshold voltage.\n\n### 11.3.1 Short-Channel Effects\n\nFor the ideal MOSFET, we have derived the threshold voltage using the concept of charge neutrality in which the sum of charges in the metal oxide inversion layer and\n\n**Figure 11.13** | Cross section of a long n-channel MOSFET (a) at flat band and (b) at inversion.\n\nThe semiconductor space charge region is zero. We assumed that the gate area was the same as the active area in the semiconductor. Using this assumption, we have considered only equivalent surface charge densities and neglected any effects on threshold voltage that may occur due to source and drain space charge regions that extend into the active channel region.\n\nFigure 11.13a shows the cross section of a long n-channel MOSFET at flat band, with zero source and drain voltage applied. The space charge regions at the source and drain extend into the channel region but occupy only a small fraction of the entire channel region. The gate voltage, then, will control essentially all of the space charge induced in the channel region at inversion as shown in Figure 11.13b.\n\nAs the channel length decreases, the fraction of charge in the channel region controlled by the gate decreases. This effect can be seen in Figure 11.14 for the flat-band condition. As the drain voltage increases, the reverse-biased space charge region at the drain extends further into the channel area and the gate controls even less bulk charge. The amount of charge in the channel region, \\( Q_{SD}(max) \\), controlled by the gate, affects the threshold voltage and can be seen from Equation (11.24)\n\n\\[\nV_{TN} = (|Q_{SD}(max)| - Q'_{I}) \\left( \\frac{t_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\right) + \\phi_{ms} + 2\\phi_{fp}\n\\]\n\n(11.24)\n\nWe can quantitatively determine the short-channel effects on the threshold voltage by considering the parameters shown in Figure 11.15. The source and drain junctions are characterized by a diffused junction depth \\( x_j \\). We will assume that the lateral diffusion distance under the gate is the same as the vertical diffusion distance. This assumption is a reasonably good approximation for diffused junctions but becomes less accurate for ion implanted junctions. We will initially consider the case when the source, drain, and body contacts are all at ground potential.\n\nThe basic assumption in this analysis is that the bulk charge in the trapezoidal region under the gate is controlled by the gate. The potential difference across the bulk space charge region is \\( 2\\phi_{fp} \\) at the threshold inversion point, and the built-in potential barrier height of the source and drain junctions is also approximately \\( 2\\phi_{fp} \\), implying that the three space charge widths are essentially equal. We can then write\n\n\\[\nx_s \\approx x_d \\approx x_{eff} = x_{jT}\n\\]\n\n(11.25)\n\n**Figure 11.14** | Cross section of a short n-channel MOSFET at flat band.\n\n**Figure 11.15** | Charge sharing in the short-channel threshold voltage model.  \n*(From Yau [261].)*\n\nUsing the geometrical approximation, the average bulk charge per unit area \\( Q_B \\) in the trapezoid is\n\n\\[\n|Q_B| \\cdot L = eN_Ax_{dT} \\left( \\frac{L + L'}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(11.26)\n\nFrom the geometry, we can show that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L + L'}{2L} = \\left[ 1 - \\frac{r_j}{L} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2x_{dT}}{r_j}} - 1 \\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(11.27)\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n|Q_B| = eN_Ax_{dT} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{r_j}{L} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2x_{dT}}{r_j}} - 1 \\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(11.28)\n\nEquation (11.28) is now used in place of \\(|Q_{B0}(max)|\\) in the expression for the threshold voltage.  \nSince \\(|Q_{B0}(max)| = eN_Ax_{dT}\\), we can find \\(\\Delta V_T\\) as\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V_T = -\\frac{eN_Ax_{dT}}{C_{ox}} \\left[ \\frac{r_j}{L} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2x_{dT}}{r_j}} - 1 \\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(11.29)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V_T = V_T(\\text{short-channel}) - V_T(\\text{long-channel})\n\\]\n\n(11.30)\n\nAs the channel length decreases, the threshold voltage shifts in the negative direction so that an n-channel MOSFET shifts toward depletion mode.\n\nThe effect of short channels becomes more pronounced as the channel length is reduced further.\n\nThe shift in threshold voltage with channel length for an n-channel MOSFET is shown in Figure 11.16. As the substrate doping increases, the initial threshold voltage increases, as we have seen in the previous chapter, and the short-channel threshold shift also becomes larger. The short-channel effects on threshold voltage do not become significant until the channel length becomes less than approximately 2 \\(\\mu\\text{m}\\). The threshold voltage shift also becomes smaller as the diffusion depth \\( r_j \\) becomes smaller so that very shallow junctions reduce the threshold voltage dependence on channel length.\n\nEquation (11.29) is derived assuming that the source, channel, and drain space charge widths are all equal. If we now apply a drain voltage, the space charge width at the drain terminal widens, which makes \\( L' \\) smaller, and the amount of bulk charge controlled by the gate voltage decreases. This effect makes the threshold voltage a function of drain voltage. As the drain voltage increases, the threshold voltage of an n-channel MOSFET decreases. The threshold voltage versus channel length is\n\n\n**Figure 11.16**\n- **Description**: Threshold voltage versus channel length for various substrate dopings.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - \\( t_{\\text{ox}} = 50 \\, \\text{nm} \\)\n  - \\( t_j = 0.5 \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\)\n  - \\( V_{GB} = 5 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n  - \\( N_a = 10^{15}, 10^{16}, 5 \\times 10^{16}, 10^{17} \\)\n\n**Figure 11.17**\n- **Description**: Threshold voltage versus channel length for two values of drain-to-source and body-to-source voltage.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - \\( V_{DS} = 0.125 \\, \\text{V}, 4 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n  - \\( V_{BS} = 0 \\, \\text{V}, 1.25 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n\nplotted in Figure 11.17 for two values of drain-to-source voltage and two values of body-to-source voltage.\n\n### 11.3.2 Narrow-Channel Effects\n\nFigure 11.18 shows the cross section along the channel width of an n-channel MOSFET biased at inversion. The current is perpendicular to the channel width through the inversion charge. We may note in the figure that there is an additional space charge region at each end of the channel width. This additional charge is controlled by the gate voltage but is not included in the derivation of the ideal threshold voltage relation. The threshold voltage expression must be modified to include this additional charge.\n\n**Figure 11.18**\n- **Description**: Cross section of an n-channel MOSFET showing the depletion region along the width of the device.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - \\( L \\)\n  - \\( x_{\\text{df}} \\)\n  - \\( W \\)\n  - p type\n\nIf we neglect short-channel effects, the gate-controlled bulk charge can be written as\n\n\\[\nQ_B = Q_{B0} + \\Delta Q_B\n\\]\n\n(11.31)\n\nwhere \\( Q_B \\) is the total bulk charge, \\( Q_{B0} \\) is the ideal bulk charge, and \\( \\Delta Q_B \\) is the additional bulk charge at the ends of the channel width. For a uniformly doped p-type semiconductor biased at the threshold inversion point, we may write\n\n\\[\n|Q_{B0}| = eN_sWLx_{tr}\n\\]\n\n(11.32)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Q_B = eN_sLx_{tr}(\\xi x_{tr})\n\\]\n\n(11.33)\n\nwhere \\( \\xi \\) is a fitting parameter that accounts for the lateral space charge width.

If the ends were a semicircle, then \\( \\xi = \\pi/2 \\).\n\nWe may now write\n\n\\[\n|Q_B| = |Q_{B0}| + |\\Delta Q_B| = eN_sWLx_{tr} + eN_sLx_{tr}(\\xi x_{tr})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= eN_sWLx_{tr} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\xi x_{tr}}{W} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(11.34)\n\nThe effect of the end space charge regions becomes significant as the width \\( W \\) decreases and the factor \\( (\\xi x_{tr}) \\) becomes a significant fraction of the width \\( W \\).\n\nThe change in threshold voltage due to the additional space charge is\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V_T = \\frac{eN_sx_{tr}}{C_{ox}} \\left( \\frac{\\xi x_{tr}}{W} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(11.35)\n\nThe shift in threshold voltage due to a narrow channel is in the positive direction for the n-channel MOSFET. As the width \\( W \\) becomes smaller, the shift in threshold voltage becomes larger.\n\nFigure 11.19 shows the threshold voltage as a function of channel width. We can again note that the threshold voltage shift begins to become apparent for channel widths that are large compared to the induced space charge width.\n\nFigure 11.20a, b shows qualitatively the threshold voltage shifts due to short-channel and narrow-channel effects, respectively, in n-channel MOSFETs. The narrow-channel device produces a larger threshold voltage; the short-channel device produces a smaller threshold voltage. For devices exhibiting both short-channel and narrow-channel effects, the two models need to be combined into a three-dimensional volume approximation of the space charge region controlled by the gate.\n\n**Figure 11.19** | Threshold voltage versus channel width (solid curves, theoretical; points, experimental).  \n- Width \\(W\\) (\\(\\mu m\\)) vs. Threshold Voltage (Volts) \n- \\(N_a = 1.71 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\)\n- \\(N_a = 1.55 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\)\n- \\(N_a = 1.25 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\)",

    "text": "## 11.4 ADDITIONAL ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nThere is a tremendous volume of information on MOSFETs that cannot be included in an introductory text on semiconductor physics and devices. However, two additional topics should be included here: breakdown voltage and threshold adjustment by ion implantation.\n\n### 11.4.1 Breakdown Voltage\nSeveral voltage breakdown mechanisms in the MOSFET must be considered, including voltage breakdown across the oxide as well as the various voltage breakdown mechanisms in the semiconductor junctions.\n\n**Oxide Breakdown**\nWe have assumed that the oxide is a perfect insulator. However, if the electric field in the oxide becomes large enough, breakdown can occur, which can lead to a catastrophic failure. In silicon dioxide, the electric field at breakdown is on the order of \\(6 \\times 10^6\\) V/cm. This breakdown field is larger than that in silicon, but the gate oxides are also quite thin. A gate voltage of approximately 30 V would produce breakdown in an oxide with a thickness of 500 Å. However, a safety margin of a factor of 3 is common, so that the maximum safe gate voltage with \\(t_{ox} = 500\\) Å would be 10 V. A safety margin is necessary since there may be defects in the oxide that lower the breakdown field. Oxide breakdown is normally not a serious problem except in power devices and ultrathin oxide devices. Other oxide degradation problems are discussed later in this chapter.\n\n**Avalanche Breakdown**\n\nAvalanche breakdown may occur by impact ionization in the space charge region near the drain terminal. We have considered avalanche breakdown in pn junctions in Chapter 7. In an ideal planar one-sided pn junction, breakdown is a function primarily of the doping concentration in the low-doped region of the junction. For the MOSFET, the low-doped region corresponds to the semiconductor substrate. If a p-type substrate doping is \\(N_a = 3 \\times 10^{15}\\) cm\\(^{-3}\\), for example, the pn junction breakdown voltage would be approximately 25 V for a planar junction. However, the n\\(^+\\) drain contact may be a fairly shallow diffused region with\n\n\n**Figure 11.20** Qualitative variation of threshold voltage (a) with channel length and (b) with channel width.\n\n**Figure 11.21** | Curvature effect on the electric field in the drain junction.\n\n**Figure 11.22** | Current–voltage characteristic showing the snapback breakdown effect.\n\nA large curvature. The electric field in the depletion region tends to be concentrated at the curvature, which lowers the breakdown voltage. This curvature effect is shown in Figure 11.21.\n\n#### Near Avalanche and Snapback Breakdown\n\nAnother breakdown mechanism results in the S-shaped breakdown curve shown in Figure 11.22. This breakdown process is due to second order effects and can be explained with the aid of Figure 11.23. The n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET geometry in Figure 11.23a shows the\n\n\n*This section may be postponed until after the bipolar transistor is considered in Chapter 12.*\n\n\n**Figure 11.23** (a) Cross section of the n-channel MOSFET. (b) Equivalent circuit including the parasitic bipolar transistor.\n\nn-type source and drain contacts along with the p-type substrate. The source and body are at ground potential. The n(source)-p(substrate)-n(drain) structure also forms a parasitic bipolar transistor. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 11.23b.\n\nFigure 11.24a shows the device when avalanche breakdown is just beginning in the space charge region near the drain. We tend to think of the avalanche breakdown suddenly occurring at a particular voltage. However, avalanche breakdown is a gradual process that starts at low current levels and for electric fields somewhat below the breakdown field. The electrons generated by the avalanche process flow into the drain and contribute to the drain current. The avalanche-generated holes generally flow through the substrate to the body terminal. Since the substrate has a nonzero resistance, a voltage drop is produced as shown. This potential difference drives the source-to-substrate pn junction into forward bias near the source terminal. The source is heavily doped n-type; thus, a large number of electrons can be injected from the source contact into the substrate under forward bias. This process becomes\n\n\n**Figure 11.24** (a) Substrate current–induced voltage drop caused by avalanche multiplication at the drain. (b) Currents in the parasitic bipolar transistor.\n\nSevere as the voltage drop in the substrate approaches 0.6 to 0.7 V. A fraction of the injected electrons diffuses across the parasitic base region into the reverse-biased drain space charge region where they also add to the drain current.\n\nThe avalanche breakdown process is a function of not only the electric field but the number of carriers involved. The rate of avalanche breakdown increases as the number of carriers in the drain space charge region increases. We now have a regenerative or positive feedback mechanism. Avalanche breakdown near the drain terminal produces the substrate current, which produces the forward-biased source-substrate pn junction voltage. The forward-biased junction injects carriers that can diffuse back to the drain and increase the avalanche process. The positive feedback produces an unstable system.\n\nThe snapback or negative resistance portion of the curve shown in Figure 11.22 can now be explained by using the parasitic bipolar transistor. The potential of the base of the bipolar transistor near the emitter (source) is almost floating, since this voltage is determined primarily by the avalanche-generated substrate current rather than an externally applied voltage.\n\nFor the open-base bipolar transistor shown in Figure 11.24, we can write\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\alpha I_E + I_{CBO}\n\\]\n\n(11.36)\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha \\) is the common base current gain and \\( I_{CBO} \\) is the base-collector leakage current. For an open base, \\( I_C = I_E \\), so Equation (11.36) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\alpha I_C + I_{CBO}\n\\]\n\n(11.37)\n\nAt breakdown, the current in the B–C junction is multiplied by the multiplication factor \\( M \\), so we have\n\n\\[\nI_C = M(\\alpha I_C + I_{CBO})\n\\]\n\n(11.38)\n\nSolving for \\( I_C \\) we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\frac{M I_{CBO}}{1 - \\alpha M}\n\\]\n\n(11.39)\n\nBreakdown is defined as the condition that produces \\( I_C \\to \\infty \\). For a single reverse-biased pn junction, \\( M \\to \\infty \\) at breakdown. However, from Equation (11.39), breakdown is now defined to be the condition when \\( \\alpha M \\to 1 \\) or, for the open-base condition, breakdown occurs when \\( M \\to 1/\\alpha \\), which is a much lower multiplication factor than for the simple pn junction.\n\nAn empirical relation for the multiplication factor is usually written as\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{1}{1 - (V_{CE}/V_{BD})^m}\n\\]\n\n(11.40)\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is an empirical constant in the range of 3 to 6 and \\( V_{BD} \\) is the junction breakdown voltage.\n\nThe common base current gain factor \\( \\alpha \\) is a strong function of collector current for small values of collector current. This effect will be discussed in Chapter 12 on bipolar transistors. At low currents, the recombination current in the B–E junction is a significant fraction of the total current so that the common base current gain is small.\n\n#### Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor: Additional Concepts\n\nAs the collector current increases, the value of \\( \\alpha \\) increases. As avalanche breakdown begins and \\( I_C \\) is small, particular values of \\( M \\) and \\( V_{CE} \\) are required to produce the condition of \\( \\alpha M = 1 \\). As the collector current increases, \\( \\alpha \\) increases; therefore, smaller values of \\( M \\) and \\( V_{CE} \\) are required to produce the avalanche breakdown condition. The snapback, or negative resistance, breakdown characteristic is then produced.\n\nOnly a fraction of the injected electrons from the forward-biased source-substrate junction are collected by the drain terminal. A more exact calculation of the snapback characteristic would necessarily involve taking into account this fraction; thus, the simple model would need to be modified. However, the above discussion qualitatively describes the snapback effect. The snapback effect can be minimized by using a heavily doped substrate that will prevent any significant voltage drop from being developed. A thin epitaxial p-type layer with the proper doping concentration to produce the required threshold voltage can be grown on a heavily doped substrate.\n\n#### Near Punch-Through Effects\n\nPunch-through is the condition at which the drain-to-substrate space charge region extends completely across the channel region to the source-to-substrate space charge region. In this situation, the barrier between the source and drain is completely eliminated and a very large drain current would exist.\n\nHowever, the drain current will begin to increase rapidly before the actual punch-through condition is reached. This characteristic is referred to as the near punch-through condition, also known as Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). Figure 11.25a shows the ideal energy-band diagram from source to drain for a long n-channel MOSFET for the case when \\( V_{GS} < V_T \\) and when the drain-to-source voltage is relatively small. The large potential barriers prevent significant current between the drain and source. Figure 11.25b shows the energy-band diagram when a relatively large drain voltage \\( V_{DS2} \\) is applied. The space charge region near the drain terminal is beginning to interact with the source space charge region and the potential barrier is being lowered. Since the current is an exponential function of barrier height, the current will increase very rapidly with drain voltage once this near punch-through condition is reached.\n\n**Figure 11.25** (a) Equipotential plot along the surface of a long-channel MOSFET.  \n(b) Equipotential plot along the surface of a short-channel MOSFET before and after punch-through.\n\n**Figure 11.26** | Typical \\( I-V \\) characteristics of a MOSFET exhibiting punch-through effects.\n\nCondition has been reached. Figure 11.26 shows some typical characteristics of a short-channel device with a near punch-through condition.\n\nFor a doping of \\( 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\), the two space charge regions will begin to interact when the abrupt depletion layers are approximately 0.25 μm apart. The drain voltage at which this near punch-through condition, also known as drain-induced barrier lowering, occurs is significantly less than the ideal punch-through voltage such as calculated in Example 11.5 (see Problem 11.33).\n\n### *11.4.2 The Lightly Doped Drain Transistor\n\nThe junction breakdown voltage is a function of the maximum electric field. As the channel length becomes smaller, the bias voltages may not be scaled down accordingly, so the junction electric fields become larger. As the electric field increases, near avalanche breakdown and near punch-through effects become more serious. In addition, as device geometries are scaled down, the parasitic bipolar device becomes more dominant and breakdown effects are enhanced.\n\nOne approach that reduces these breakdown effects is to alter the doping profile of the drain contact. The Lightly Doped Drain (LDD) design and doping profiles are shown in Figure 11.27a, the conventional MOSFET and doping profiles are shown in Figure 11.27b for comparison. By introducing the lightly doped region, the peak electric field in the space charge region is reduced and the breakdown effects are minimized. The peak electric field at the drain junction is a function of the semiconductor doping as well as the curvature of the n+ drain region. Figure 11.28 shows the physical geometries of a conventional n+ drain contact and an LDD structure superimposed on the same plot. The magnitude of the electric field at the oxide–semiconductor interface in the LDD structure is less than in the conventional structure. The electric field in the conventional device peaks approximately at the metallurgical junction and drops quickly to zero in the drain because no field can exist in the highly conductive n+ region. On the other hand, the electric field in the LDD device extends across the n-region before dropping to zero at the drain. This effect minimizes breakdown and the hot electron effects, which we discuss in Section 11.5.3.\n\nTwo disadvantages of the LDD device are an increase in both fabrication complexity and drain resistance. The added processing steps, however, produce a device with significant improvements in performance. The cross section of the LDD device\n\n**Figure 11.27** (a) The lightly doped drain (LDD) structure. (b) Conventional structure.  \n*(From Ogura et al.

The added series resistances increase power dissipation in the device, which must be considered in high-power devices.\n\n### 11.4.3 Threshold Adjustment by Ion Implantation\n\nSeveral factors, such as fixed oxide charge, metal–semiconductor work function difference, oxide thickness, and semiconductor doping, influence the threshold voltage. Although all of these parameters may be fixed in a particular design and fabrication process, the resulting threshold voltage may not be acceptable for all applications. Ion implantation can be used to change and adjust the substrate doping near the oxide–semiconductor surface to provide the desired threshold voltage. In addition, ion implantation is used for more than doping the channel. It is used extensively as a standard part of device fabrication; for example, it is used to form the source and drain regions of the transistor.\n\nTo change the doping and thereby change the threshold voltage, a precise, controlled number of either donor or acceptor ions are implanted into the semiconductor near the oxide surface. When an MOS device is biased in either depletion or inversion and when the implanted dopant atoms are within the induced space charge region, then the ionized dopant charge adds to (or subtracts from) the maximum space charge density, which controls the threshold voltage. An implant of acceptor ions into either a p- or n-type substrate will shift the threshold voltage to more positive values, while an implant of donor ions will shift the threshold voltage to more negative values. Ion implantation can be carried out to change a depletion-mode device to enhancement-mode or an enhancement-mode device to depletion-mode, which is an important application of this technology.\n\nAs a first approximation, assume that \\( D_I \\) acceptor atoms per cm\\(^2\\) are implanted into a p-type substrate directly adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface as shown in Figure 11.29a. The shift in threshold voltage due to the implant is\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V_T = + \\frac{eD_I}{C_{ox}}\n\\]\n\n(11.41)\n\nIf donor atoms were implanted into the p-type substrate, the space charge density would be reduced; thus, the threshold voltage would shift in the negative voltage direction.\n\n\n**Figure 11.29** (a) Ion-implanted profile approximated by a delta function. (b) Ion-implanted profile approximated by a step function in which the depth \\( x_i \\) is less than the space charge width \\( x_{dT} \\).\n\n| Metal | Oxide | p-type semiconductor |\n|-------|-------|-----------------------|\n|       |       | \\( D_I \\) (cm\\(^{-2}\\)) |\n|       |       | \\( N_a \\)              |\n| \\( x = 0 \\) | \\( x = x_{dT} \\) |       |\n\n| Metal | Oxide | p-type semiconductor |\n|-------|-------|-----------------------|\n|       |       | \\( N_s \\)             |\n|       |       | \\( N_a \\)             |\n| \\( x = 0 \\) | \\( x = x_i, x = x_{dT} \\) | |\n\nA second type of implant approximation is the step junction, shown in Figure 11.29b. If the induced space charge width at the threshold inversion point is less than \\( x_t \\), then the threshold voltage is determined on the basis of a semiconductor with a uniform doping concentration of \\( N_t \\) atoms per cm\\(^3\\). On the other hand, if the induced space charge width is greater than \\( x_t \\) at the threshold inversion point, then a new expression for \\( x_{dT} \\) must be derived. We can apply Poisson’s equation and show that the maximum induced space charge width after the step implant is\n\n\\[\nx_{dT} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s}{e N_t} \\left[ 2 \\phi_{fp} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox} t_{ox}^2}{2 \\varepsilon_{s}} (N_t - N_a) \\right]^{1/2}}\n\\]\n\n(11.42)\n\nThe threshold voltage after a step implant for the case when \\( x_{dT} > x_t \\) can be written as\n\n\\[\nV_T = V_{T0} + \\frac{e D_I}{C_{ox}}\n\\]\n\n(11.43)\n\nwhere \\( V_{T0} \\) is the preimplant threshold voltage. The parameter \\( D_I \\) is given by\n\n\\[\nD_I = (N_t - N_a)x_{dT}\n\\]\n\n(11.44)\n\nwhich is the number per cm\\(^2\\) of implanted ions. The preimplant threshold voltage is\n\n\\[\nV_{T0} = V_{FB0} + 2 \\phi_{fp0} + \\frac{e N_a x_{dT0}}{C_{ox}}\n\\]\n\n(11.45)\n\nwhere the subscript 0 indicates the preimplant values.\n\nThe actual implant dose versus distance is neither a delta function nor a step function; it tends to be a Gaussian-type distribution.

    "text": "## 11.5 | Radiation and Hot-Electron Effects\n\nWe have considered the effects of fixed trapped oxide charge and interface state charge on the capacitance–voltage characteristics of MOS capacitors and on the MOSFET characteristics. These charges can exist because the oxide is essentially a perfect dielectric and a net charge density can exist in a dielectric material. Two processes that generate these charges are ionizing radiation and impact ionization in the drain region of a MOSFET operating near avalanche breakdown.\n\nMOS devices are exposed to ionizing radiation, for example, in communication satellites orbiting through the Van Allen radiation belts. The ionizing radiation can produce additional fixed oxide charge and also additional interface states. In this short discussion of radiation effects in MOSFETs, we are concerned only with the permanent effects that occur in the device characteristics.\n\nAnother source can generate oxide charge and interface states: the hot electron effect. Electrons near the drain terminal of a MOSFET operating near avalanche breakdown can have energies that are much larger than the thermal-equilibrium value. These hot electrons have energies sufficient to penetrate the oxide–semiconductor barrier.\n\n### 11.5.1 Radiation-Induced Oxide Charge\n\nGamma-rays or x-rays incident on semiconductor or oxide materials can interact with valence band electrons. The incident radiation photons can impart enough energy to a valence electron to elevate the electron into the conduction band; an empty state or hole is also produced in the valence band. This process generates electron–hole pairs. These newly generated electrons and holes can move through a material under the influence of an electric field.\n\nFigure 11.30 shows the energy-band diagram of an MOS device with a p-type substrate and a positive gate voltage. The bandgap energy of silicon dioxide is approximately 9 eV.\n\n\n**Figure 11.30** | Schematic of ionizing radiation–induced processes in an MOS capacitor with a positive gate bias.  \n(From Ma and Dressendorfer [71].)\n\n1. **Electron–hole pairs generated by ionizing radiation**\n2. **Hopping transport of holes through localized states in SiO₂ bulk**\n3. **Deep hole trapping near Si/SiO₂ interface**\n4. **Radiation-induced interface traps within Si bandgap**\n\n- **SiO₂**\n- **Si**\n- **E_C**\n- **E_F**\n- **E_V**\n- **1.1 eV**\n\napproximately 9 eV. The figure schematically shows the creation of an electron–hole pair in the oxide by ionizing radiation. The force on the radiation-induced electron is toward the gate and the force on the radiation-induced hole is toward the semiconductor. It has been found that generated electrons in the oxide are fairly mobile, with a mobility value on the order of 20 cm\\(^2\\)/V·s. At high electric fields, the electron velocity in the oxide also saturates at approximately 10\\(^7\\) cm/s, so that the electron transit time for typical gate oxide thicknesses is on the order of a few picoseconds. For positive gate voltages, the vast majority of radiation-induced electrons flow out through the gate terminal; for this reason, in general these electrons do not play a significant role in the radiation response of MOS devices.\n\nThe generated holes, on the other hand, undergo a stochastic hopping transport process through the oxide (shown schematically in Figure 11.30). The hole transport process is dispersive in time and is a function of the electric field, temperature, and oxide thickness. The effective hole mobility in silicon dioxide is typically in the range of 10\\(^-4\\) to 10\\(^-11\\) cm\\(^2\\)/V·s; thus, holes are relatively immobile when compared with electrons.\n\nWhen holes reach the silicon–silicon dioxide (Si–SiO\\(_2\\)) interface, a fraction are captured in trapping sites while the remainder flow into the silicon. A net positive radiation-induced charge is then trapped in the oxide due to these captured holes. This trapped charge can last from hours to years. As we have seen, a positive oxide charge causes a negative shift in threshold voltage.\n\nThe measured areal hole trap densities are in the range of 10\\(^12\\) to 10\\(^13\\) cm\\(^-2\\) depending upon oxide and device processing. In general, these traps are located within approximately 50 Å of the Si–SiO\\(_2\\) interface. The hole trap is usually associated with a trivalent silicon defect that has an oxygen vacancy in the SiO\\(_2\\) structure. The oxygen vacancies are located in a silicon-rich region near the Si–SiO\\(_2\\) interface.\n\nSince the threshold or flat-band voltage shift is a function of the amount of trapped charge, the voltage shift is a function of applied voltage across the oxide. Figure 11.31 shows the flat-band voltage shift of an MOS capacitor as a function of gate voltage applied during irradiation. For small values of gate voltage, some radiation-generated\n\n**Figure 11.31** | Radiation-induced flat-band voltage shift in an MOS capacitor as a function of applied gate bias during irradiation.  \n---|---  \n(From Ma and Dressendorfer [7].)\n\n- **Dose** = 10\\(^6\\) rad (Si)  \n- \\(t_{\\text{ox}} = 70\\) nm  \n- **Gate voltage (V)**  \n- **\\(-\\Delta V_{\\text{fb}}\\) (V)**\n\n| Gate voltage (V) | \\(-\\Delta V_{\\text{fb}}\\) (V) |\n|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| -10              | 0.0                           |\n| -5               | 0.0                           |\n| 0                | 0.0                           |\n| +5               | 0.5                           |\n| +10              | 1.5                           |\n\nholes and electrons recombine in the oxide. Hence, the amount of charge reaching the Si–SiO₂ interface and being trapped is less than for a large positive gate voltage, where essentially all radiation-generated holes reach the interface without recombining with electrons. If the fraction of generated holes that become trapped is relatively constant, then the voltage shift becomes independent of positive gate bias, as shown in the figure. For negative applied gate voltages, the radiation-induced holes move toward the gate terminal. There can be positive charge trapping in the oxide near the gate, but the effect of this trapped charge on the threshold voltage is small.\n\nOne failure mechanism, therefore, caused by the radiation-induced oxide charge in an n-channel MOSFET in an integrated circuit is a shift from enhancement mode to depletion mode. The device will be turned on rather than off at zero gate voltage; consequently, the circuit function may be disrupted or an excessive power supply current may be generated in the circuit.\n\n### 11.5.2 Radiation-Induced Interface States\n\nWe have considered the effect of interface states on the C–V characteristics of an MOS capacitor and on the MOSFET characteristics. The net charge in the interface states of an n-channel MOS device at the threshold inversion point is negative. This negative charge causes a shift in threshold voltage in the positive voltage direction, which is opposite to the shift due to the positive oxide charge. In addition, since the interface states can be charged, they are another source of coulomb interaction with the inversion charge carrier, which means that the inversion carrier mobility is a function of the interface state density through surface-scattering effects. Interface states, then, affect both threshold voltage and carrier mobility.\n\nWhen MOS devices are exposed to ionizing radiation, additional interface states are generated at the Si-SiO\\(_2\\) interface. The radiation-induced interface states tend to be donor states in the lower half of the bandgap and acceptor states in the upper half. Figure 11.32 shows the threshold voltage in an n-channel and a p-channel MOSFET as a function of ionizing radiation dose. We initially see the negative threshold voltage shift in both devices due to the radiation-induced positive oxide charge. The reversal in threshold shift at the higher dose levels is attributable to the creation of radiation-induced interface states that tend to compensate the radiation-induced positive oxide charge.\n\nIn our discussion of subthreshold conduction, we have mentioned that the slope of the ln \\(I_D\\) versus \\(V_{GS}\\) curves in the subthreshold region is a function of the density of interface states. Figure 11.33 shows the subthreshold current at several total ionizing dose levels.\n\n**Figure 11.32** | Threshold voltage versus total ionizing radiation dose of (a) an n-channel MOSFET and (b) a p-channel MOSFET.  \n*(From Ma and Dressendorfer [71].)*\n\n\n**Figure 11.33** | Subthreshold current versus gate voltage of a MOSFET prior to irradiation and at four total radiation dose levels.  \n*(From Ma and Dressendorfer [71].)*\n\n- **Figure 11.32**: Threshold voltage versus total ionizing radiation dose for n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs.\n- **Figure 11.33**: Subthreshold current versus gate voltage of a MOSFET at various radiation dose levels.\n\n**Figure 11.34** | Radiation-induced interface state density versus time after a pulse of ionizing radiation for several values of oxide electric field.  \n(From Ma and Dressendorfer [71].)\n\n\nThe change in slope indicates that the density of interface states is increasing with total dose.\n\nThe buildup of radiation-induced interface states occurs over a relatively long time period and is a very strong function of the applied electric field in the oxide. Figure 11.34 shows the radiation-induced interface state density versus time for several applied fields. The final interface state density is reached between 100 to 10,000 seconds after a pulse of ionizing radiation. Almost all models for the generation of radiation-induced interface states depend on the transport or trapping of radiation-generated holes near the Si-SiO\\(_2\\) interface. This transport and trapping process is time and field dependent, supporting the time and field dependence of the interface state buildup.\n\nThe sensitivity of the Si-SiO\\(_2\\) interface to the buildup of radiation-induced interface states is a strong function of device processing. The interface state buildup in aluminum-gate MOSFETs tends to be smaller than in polysilicon-gate devices. This difference is probably more a result of variations between the two processing technologies than an inherent difference. Hydrogen appears to be important in the radiation-induced interface state buildup—hydrogen tends to passivate dangling silicon bonds at the interface, reducing the preradiation density of interface states. However, devices passivated with hydrogen appear to be more susceptible to the buildup of radiation-induced interface states. The silicon–hydrogen bond at the interface may be broken by the radiation process, which leaves a dangling silicon bond that acts like an interface state trap. These traps at the interface have been identified through electron spin resonance experiments.\n\nInterface states may seriously affect the MOSFET characteristics, which in turn can affect MOSFET circuit performance. Radiation-induced interface states can cause shifts in threshold voltage, affecting circuit performance as we have discussed. A reduction in mobility can affect the speed and output drive capability of a circuit.\n\n### 11.5.3 Hot-Electron Charging Effects\n\nWe have considered breakdown voltage effects in a MOSFET. In particular, as the electric field in the drain junction space charge region increases, electron–hole pairs can be generated by impact ionization. The generated electrons tend to be swept to the drain and generated holes swept into the substrate in an n-channel MOSFET.\n\nSome of the electrons generated in the space charge region are attracted to the oxide due to the electric field induced by a positive gate voltage; this effect is shown in Figure 11.35. These generated electrons have energies far greater than the thermal-equilibrium value and are called hot electrons. If the electrons have energies on the order of 1.5 eV, they may be able to tunnel into the oxide; or in some cases they may be able to overcome the silicon oxide potential barrier and produce a gate current, which may be in the range of femtoamperes (fA) \\( (10^{-15} \\, \\text{A}) \\) or perhaps picoamperes (pA) \\( (10^{-12} \\, \\text{A}) \\). A fraction of the electrons traveling through the oxide may be trapped, producing a net negative charge density in the oxide. The probability of electron trapping is usually less than that of hole trapping; but a hot-electron-induced gate current may exist over a long period of time, therefore the negative charging effect may build up. The negative oxide charge trapping will cause a local positive shift in the threshold voltage.\n\nThe energetic electrons, as they cross the Si–SiO\\(_2\\) interface, can generate additional interface states. The probable cause of interface state generation is due to the breaking up of silicon-hydrogen bonds—a dangling silicon bond is produced, which acts as an interface state. The charge trapping in interface states causes a shift in threshold voltage, additional surface scattering, and reduced mobility. The hot-electron charging effects are continuous processes, so the device degrades over a period of time. This degradation is obviously an undesirable effect and may tend to limit the useful life of the device. We have discussed the lightly doped drain (LDD) structure in Section 11.4.2. The maximum electric field is reduced in this device, decreasing the probability of impact ionization and hot-electron effects.\n\n**Figure 11.35** | Hot carrier generation, current components, and electron injection into the oxide.",

    "text": "## 11.6 | SUMMARY\n\n- Advanced concepts of MOSFETs have been discussed in this chapter.\n- Subthreshold conduction means that the drain current in a MOSFET is not zero even when the gate-to-source voltage is less than the threshold voltage. In this situation, the transistor is based in the weak inversion mode and the drain current is dominated by the diffusion rather than the drift mechanism.\n- The effective channel length decreases with an increase in drain voltage when the MOSFET is biased in the saturation region, since the depletion region at the drain extends into the channel. This effect is known as channel length modulation.\n- The mobility of carriers in the inversion layer is not a constant. As the gate voltage increases, the transverse electric field at the oxide interface increases, causing additional surface scattering. The increased carrier scattering leads to a reduced mobility and a deviation from the ideal current–voltage relation.\n- As the channel length decreases, the lateral electric field increases so that carriers flowing through the channel may reach their saturation velocity. In this case, the drain current becomes a linear function of gate-to-source voltage.\n- The tendency in MOSFET design is to make devices smaller. The principle of constant-field scaling has been discussed.\n- Modification in threshold voltage as device dimensions shrink has been discussed.\n- Because of charge-sharing effects in the substrate, the threshold voltage decreases as channel length decreases and increases as channel width decreases.\n- Several voltage breakdown mechanisms have been discussed. These include oxide breakdown, avalanche breakdown, near avalanche or snapback breakdown, and near punch-through effects. These mechanisms are all enhanced as device dimensions shrink.\n- The lightly doped drain transistor tends to minimize the drain breakdown effects.\n- Ion implantation can be used as essentially a final process step to change and adjust the substrate doping in the channel region to provide the desired threshold voltage. This process is referred to as threshold voltage adjustment by ion implantation and is used extensively in device fabrication.\n- The effect of ionization radiation and hot-electron effects on MOSFET behavior have been briefly discussed.",

    "text": "## 7.1 BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE pn JUNCTION\n\nFigure 7.1a schematically shows the pn junction. It is important to realize that the entire semiconductor is a single-crystal material in which one region is doped with acceptor impurity atoms to form the p region and the adjacent region is doped with donor atoms to form the n region. The interface separating the n and p regions is referred to as the **metallurgical junction**.\n\nThe impurity doping concentrations in the p and n regions are shown in Figure 7.1b. For simplicity, we will consider a **step junction** in which the doping concentration is uniform in each region and there is an abrupt change in doping at the junction. Initially, at the metallurgical junction, there is a very large density gradient in both electron and hole concentrations. Majority carrier electrons in the n region will begin diffusing into the p region, and majority carrier holes in the p region will begin diffusing into the n region. If we assume there are no external connections to the semiconductor, then this diffusion process cannot continue indefinitely. As electrons diffuse from the n region, positively charged donor atoms are left behind. Similarly, as holes diffuse from the p region, they uncover negatively charged acceptor atoms. The net positive and negative charges in the n and p regions induce an electric field in the region near the metallurgical junction, in the direction from the positive to the negative charge, or from the n to the p region.\n\nThe net positively and negatively charged regions are shown in Figure 7.2. These two regions are referred to as the **space charge region**. Essentially all electrons and holes are swept out of the space charge region by the electric field. Since the space charge region is depleted of any mobile charge, this region is also referred to as the **depletion region**; these two terms will be used interchangeably. Density gradients still exist in the majority carrier concentrations at each edge of the space charge region. We can think of a density gradient as producing a \"diffusion force\" that acts on the majority carriers. These diffusion forces, acting on the electrons and holes at the edges of the space charge region, are shown in the figure. The electric field in the space charge region produces another force on the electrons and holes, which is in the opposite direction to the diffusion force for each type of particle. In thermal equilibrium, the diffusion force and the E-field force exactly balance each other.\n\n\n**Figure 7.1** (a) Simplified geometry of a pn junction; (b) doping profile of an ideal uniformly doped pn junction.\n\n\n**Figure 7.2** The space charge region, the electric field, and the forces acting on the charged carriers.\n\n- **Figure 7.1a**: Shows the metallurgical junction between p and n regions.\n- **Figure 7.1b**: Illustrates the doping profile with \\( N_a \\) and \\( N_d \\) indicating acceptor and donor concentrations, respectively.\n\n- **Figure 7.2**: Depicts the space charge region, electric field (E-field), and diffusion forces on holes and electrons.

    "text": "## 7.2 Zero Applied Bias\n\nWe have considered the basic pn junction structure and discussed briefly how the space charge region is formed. In this section we will examine the properties of the step junction in thermal equilibrium, where no currents exist and no external excitation is applied. We will determine the space charge region width, electric field, and potential through the depletion region.\n\nThe analysis in this chapter is based on two assumptions that we have considered in previous chapters. The first assumption is that the Boltzmann approximation is valid, which means that each semiconductor region is nondegenerately doped. The second assumption is that complete ionization exists, which means that the temperature of the pn junction is not \"too low.\"\n\n### 7.2.1 Built-in Potential Barrier\n\nIf we assume that no voltage is applied across the pn junction, then the junction is in thermal equilibrium—the Fermi energy level is constant throughout the entire system. Figure 7.3 shows the energy-band diagram for the pn junction in thermal equilibrium. The conduction and valence band energies must bend as we go through the space charge region, since the relative position of the conduction and valence bands with respect to the Fermi energy changes between p and n regions.\n\n**Figure 7.3** | Energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium.\n\n- \\( E_c \\) and \\( E_v \\) represent the conduction and valence band energies.\n- \\( E_{Fp} \\) and \\( E_{Fn} \\) are the Fermi energy levels in the p and n regions.\n- \\( eV_0 \\) is the built-in potential barrier.\n- \\( e\\phi_{Fp} \\) and \\( e\\phi_{Fn} \\) are the energy differences between the Fermi level and the intrinsic level in the p and n regions, respectively.\n\nElectrons in the conduction band of the n region see a potential barrier in trying to move into the conduction band of the p region. This potential barrier is referred to as the **built-in potential barrier** and is denoted by \\( V_b \\). The built-in potential barrier maintains equilibrium between majority carrier electrons in the n region and minority carrier electrons in the p region, and also between majority carrier holes in the p region and minority carrier holes in the n region. This potential difference across the junction cannot be measured with a voltmeter because new potential barriers will be formed between the probes and the semiconductor that will cancel \\( V_b \\). The potential \\( V_b \\) maintains equilibrium, so no current is produced by this voltage.\n\nThe intrinsic Fermi level is equidistant from the conduction band edge through the junction; thus, the built-in potential barrier can be determined as the difference between the intrinsic Fermi levels in the p and n regions. We can define the potentials \\( \\phi_{Fn} \\) and \\( \\phi_{Fp} \\) as shown in Figure 7.3, so we have\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = |\\phi_{Fn}| + |\\phi_{Fp}|\n\\]\n\n(7.1)\n\nIn the n region, the electron concentration in the conduction band is given by\n\n\\[\nn_0 = N_c \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(E_c - E_F)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhich can also be written in the form\n\n\\[\nn_0 = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere \\( n_i \\) and \\( E_{Fi} \\) are the intrinsic carrier concentration and the intrinsic Fermi energy, respectively. We may define the potential \\( \\phi_{Fn} \\) in the n region as\n\n\\[\ne\\phi_{Fn} = E_{Fi} - E_F\n\\]\n\n(7.4)\n\nEquation (7.3) may then be written as\n\n\\[\nn_0 = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{-e\\phi_{Fn}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.5)\n\nTaking the natural log of both sides of Equation (7.5), setting \\( n_0 = N_d \\), and solving for the potential, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{Fn} = -\\frac{kT}{e} \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_d}{n_i} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.6)\n\nSimilarly, in the p region, the hole concentration is given by\n\n\\[\np_0 = N_a = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_{Fi} - E_F}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.7)\n\nwhere \\( N_a \\) is the acceptor concentration. We can define the potential \\( \\phi_{Fp} \\) in the p region as\n\n\\[\ne\\phi_{Fp} = E_{Fi} - E_F\n\\]\n\n(7.8)\n\nCombining Equations (7.7) and (7.8), we find that\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{fp} = \\frac{kT}{e} \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_a}{n_i} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.9)\n\nFinally, the built-in potential barrier for the step junction is found by substituting Equations (7.6) and (7.9) into Equation (7.1), which yields\n\n\\[\nV_0 = \\frac{kT}{e} \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2} \\right) = V_t \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.10)\n\nwhere \\( V_t = kT/e \\) and is defined as the thermal voltage.\n\nAt this time, we should note a subtle but important point concerning notation. Previously in the discussion of a semiconductor material, \\( N_d \\) and \\( N_a \\) denoted donor and acceptor impurity concentrations in the same region, thereby forming a compensated semiconductor. From this point on in the text, \\( N_d \\) and \\( N_a \\) will denote the net donor and acceptor concentrations in the individual n and p regions, respectively. If the p region, for example, is a compensated material, then \\( N_a \\) will represent the difference between the actual acceptor and donor impurity concentrations. The parameter \\( N_d \\) is defined in a similar manner for the n region.\n\n**Figure 7.4** The space charge density in a uniformly doped pn junction assuming the abrupt junction approximation.\n\n### 7.2.2 Electric Field\n\nAn electric field is created in the depletion region by the separation of positive and negative space charge densities. Figure 7.4 shows the volume charge density distribution in the pn junction assuming uniform doping and assuming an abrupt junction approximation. We will assume that the space charge region abruptly ends in the n region at \\( x = +x_n \\), and abruptly ends in the p region at \\( x = -x_p \\) (\\( x_p \\) is a positive quantity).\n\nThe electric field is determined from Poisson’s equation, which, for a one-dimensional analysis, is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 \\phi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s} = -\\frac{dE(x)}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(7.11)\n\nwhere \\( \\phi(x) \\) is the electric potential, \\( E(x) \\) is the electric field, \\( \\rho(x) \\) is the volume charge density, and \\( \\epsilon_s \\) is the permittivity of the semiconductor. From Figure 7.4, the charge densities are\n\n\\[\n\\rho(x) = -eN_a \\quad -x_p < x < 0\n\\]\n\n(7.12a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\rho(x) = eN_d \\quad 0 < x < x_n\n\\]\n\n(7.12b)\n\nThe electric field in the p region is found by integrating Equation (7.11). We have\n\n\\[\nE = \\int \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s} \\, dx = -\\int \\frac{eN_a}{\\epsilon_s} \\, dx = -\\frac{eN_a x}{\\epsilon_s} + C_1\n\\]\n\n(7.13)\n\nwhere \\( C_1 \\) is a constant of integration. The electric field is assumed to be zero in the neutral p region for \\( x < -x_p \\), since the currents are zero in thermal equilibrium. Since there are no surface charge densities within the pn junction structure, the electric\n\nField is a continuous function. The constant of integration is determined by setting \\( E = 0 \\) at \\( x = -x_p \\). The electric field in the p region is then given by\n\n\\[\nE = -\\frac{eN_a}{\\varepsilon_s}(x + x_p) \\quad -x_p \\leq x \\leq 0\n\\]\n\n(7.14)\n\nIn the n region, the electric field is determined from\n\n\\[\nE = \\int \\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s} \\, dx = \\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s} x + C_2\n\\]\n\n(7.15)\n\nwhere \\( C_2 \\) is again a constant of integration and is determined by setting \\( E = 0 \\) at \\( x = x_n \\), since the E-field is assumed to be zero in the n region and is a continuous function. Then\n\n\\[\nE = -\\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s}(x_n - x) \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq x_n\n\\]\n\n(7.16)\n\nThe electric field is also continuous at the metallurgical junction, or at \\( x = 0 \\). Setting Equations (7.14) and (7.16) equal to each other at \\( x = 0 \\) gives\n\n\\[\nN_a x_p = N_d x_n\n\\]\n\n(7.17)\n\nEquation (7.17) states that the number of negative charges per unit area in the p region is equal to the number of positive charges per unit area in the n region.\n\nFigure 7.5 is a plot of the electric field in the depletion region. The electric field direction is from the n to the p region, or in the negative x direction for this geometry. For the uniformly doped pn junction, the E-field is a linear function of distance through the junction, and the maximum (magnitude) electric field occurs at the metallurgical junction. An electric field exists in the depletion region even when no voltage is applied between the p and n regions.\n\nThe potential in the junction is found by integrating the electric field. In the p region then, we have\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = -\\int E(x) dx = \\int \\frac{eN_a}{\\varepsilon_s}(x + x_p) dx\n\\]\n\n(7.18)\n\n\n**Figure 7.5** Electric field in the space charge region of a uniformly doped pn junction.\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = \\frac{eN_a}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left( \\frac{x^2}{2} + x_p \\cdot x \\right) + C'_1\n\\]\n\n(7.19)\n\nwhere \\( C'_1 \\) is again a constant of integration. The potential difference through the pn junction is the important parameter, rather than the absolute potential, so we may arbitrarily set the potential equal to zero at \\( x = -x_p \\). The constant of integration is then found as\n\n\\[\nC'_1 = \\frac{eN_a}{2\\varepsilon_s} x_p^2\n\\]\n\n(7.20)\n\nso that the potential in the p region can now be written as\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = \\frac{eN_a}{2\\varepsilon_s} (x + x_p)^2 \\quad (-x_p \\leq x \\leq 0)\n\\]\n\n(7.21)\n\nThe potential in the n region is determined by integrating the electric field in the n region, or\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = \\int \\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s} (x_n - x) dx\n\\]\n\n(7.22)\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = \\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left( x \\cdot x_n - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right) + C'_2\n\\]\n\n(7.23)\n\nwhere \\( C'_2 \\) is another constant of integration. The potential is a continuous function, so setting Equation (7.21) equal to Equation (7.23) at the metallurgical junction, or at \\( x = 0 \\), gives\n\n\\[\nC'_2 = \\frac{eN_a}{2\\varepsilon_s} x_p^2\n\\]\n\n(7.24)\n\nThe potential in the n region can thus be written as\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = \\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left( x \\cdot x_n - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right) + \\frac{eN_a}{2\\varepsilon_s} x_p^2 \\quad (0 \\leq x \\leq x_n)\n\\]\n\n(7.25)\n\nFigure 7.6 is a plot of the potential through the junction and shows the quadratic dependence on distance.

The quadratic dependence on distance was shown in the energy-band diagram of Figure 7.3, although we did not explicitly know the shape of the curve at that time.\n\n**Figure 7.6** | Electric potential through the space charge region of a uniformly doped pn junction.\n\n### 7.2.3 Space Charge Width\n\nWe can determine the distance that the space charge region extends into the p and n regions from the metallurgical junction. This distance is known as the space charge width. From Equation (7.17), we may write, for example,\n\n\\[\nx_p = \\frac{N_A x_n}{N_D}\n\\]\n\n(7.27)\n\nThen, substituting Equation (7.27) into Equation (7.26) and solving for \\(x_n\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nx_n = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{e} \\left( \\frac{N_A}{N_D} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{N_A + N_D} \\right) \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(7.28)\n\nEquation (7.28) gives the space charge width, or the width of the depletion region, \\(x_n\\), extending into the n-type region for the case of zero applied voltage.\n\nSimilarly, if we solve for \\(x_p\\) from Equation (7.17) and substitute into Equation (7.26), we find\n\n\\[\nx_p = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{e} \\left( \\frac{N_D}{N_A} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{N_A + N_D} \\right) \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(7.29)\n\nwhere \\(x_p\\) is the width of the depletion region extending into the p region for the case of zero applied voltage.\n\nThe total depletion or space charge width \\(W\\) is the sum of the two components, or\n\n\\[\nW = x_n + x_p\n\\]\n\n(7.30)\n\nUsing Equations (7.28) and (7.29), we obtain\n\n\\[\nW = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{e} \\left( \\frac{N_A + N_D}{N_A N_D} \\right) \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(7.31)\n\nThe built-in potential barrier can be determined from Equation (7.10), and then the total space charge region width is obtained using Equation (7.31).",

    "text": "## 7.3 Reverse Applied Bias\n\nIf we apply a potential between the p and n regions, we will no longer be in an equilibrium condition—the Fermi energy level will no longer be constant through the system. Figure 7.7 shows the energy-band diagram of the pn junction for the case when a positive voltage is applied to the n region with respect to the p region. As the positive potential is downward, the Fermi level on the n side is below the Fermi level on the p side. The difference between the two is equal to the applied voltage in units of energy.\n\nThe total potential barrier, indicated by \\( V_{\\text{total}} \\), has increased. The applied potential is the reverse-biased condition. The total potential barrier is now given by\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = |\\phi_{p0}| + |\\phi_{n0}| + V_R\n\\]\n\n(7.32)\n\nwhere \\( V_R \\) is the magnitude of the applied reverse-biased voltage. Equation (7.32) can be rewritten as\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = V_{bi} + V_R\n\\]\n\n(7.33)\n\nwhere \\( V_{bi} \\) is the same built-in potential barrier we had defined in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### 7.3.1 Space Charge Width and Electric Field\n\nFigure 7.8 shows a pn junction with an applied reverse-biased voltage \\( V_R \\). Also indicated in the figure are the electric field in the space charge region and the electric field \\( E_{\\text{app}} \\) induced by the applied voltage. The electric fields in the neutral p and n regions are essentially zero, or at least very small, which means that the magnitude of the electric field in the space charge region must increase above the thermal-equilibrium value due to the applied voltage. The electric field originates on positive charge and terminates on negative charge; this means that the number of positive and negative\n\n\n**Figure 7.7** | Energy-band diagram of a pn junction under reverse bias.\n\n\n**Figure 7.8.1** A pn junction, with an applied reverse-biased voltage, showing the directions of the electric field induced by \\( V_R \\) and the space charge electric field.\n\ncharges must increase if the electric field increases. For given impurity doping concentrations, the number of positive and negative charges in the depletion region can be increased only if the space charge width \\( W \\) increases. The space charge width \\( W \\) increases, therefore, with an increasing reverse-biased voltage \\( V_R \\). We are assuming that the electric field in the bulk n and p regions is zero. This assumption will become clearer in the next chapter when we discuss the current–voltage characteristics.\n\nIn all of the previous equations, the built-in potential barrier can be replaced by the total potential barrier. The total space charge width can be written from Equation (7.31) as\n\n\\[\nW = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s (V_{bi} + V_R)}{e} \\left( \\frac{N_a + N_d}{N_a N_d} \\right) \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(7.34)\n\nshowing that the total space charge width increases as we apply a reverse-biased voltage. By substituting the total potential barrier \\( V_{\\text{total}} \\) into Equations (7.28) and (7.29), the space charge widths in the n and p regions, respectively, can be found as a function of applied reverse-biased voltage.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field in the depletion region increases with an applied reverse-biased voltage. The electric field is still given by Equations (7.14) and (7.16) and is still a linear function of distance through the space charge region. Since \\( x_n \\) and \\( x_p \\) increase with reverse-biased voltage, the magnitude of the electric field also increases. The maximum electric field still occurs at the metallurgical junction.\n\nThe maximum electric field at the metallurgical junction, from Equations (7.14) and (7.16), is\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{max}} = -\\frac{eN_dx_n}{\\varepsilon_s} = -\\frac{eN_ax_p}{\\varepsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(7.35)\n\nIf we use either Equation (7.28) or (7.29) in conjunction with the total potential barrier, \\( V_{bi} + V_R \\), then\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{max}} = -\\left\\{ \\frac{2e(V_{bi} + V_R)}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left( \\frac{N_aN_d}{N_a + N_d} \\right) \\right\\}^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(7.36)\n\nWe can show that the maximum electric field in the pn junction can also be written as\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{max}} = -\\frac{2(V_{bi} + V_R)}{W}\n\\]\n\n(7.37)\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the total space charge width.\n\n### 7.3.2 Junction Capacitance\n\nSince we have a separation of positive and negative charges in the depletion region, a capacitance is associated with the pn junction. Figure 7.9 shows the charge densities in the depletion region for applied reverse-biased voltages of \\( V_R \\) and \\( V_R + dV_R \\). An increase\n\n\n**Figure 7.9** | Differential change in the space charge width with a differential change in reverse-biased voltage for a uniformly doped pn junction.\n\n- **p** region: \\(-dQ'\\)\n- **n** region: \\(+dQ'\\)\n- Charge densities: \\(-eN_a\\) and \\(+eN_d\\)\n- Widths: \\(dx_p\\) and \\(dx_n\\)\n- Applied voltages: \\(V_R\\) and \\(V_R + dV_R\\)\n\nIn the reverse-biased voltage \\(dV_R\\) will uncover additional positive charges in the n region and additional negative charges in the p region.

Considering Figure 7.9, we may have come to this same conclusion earlier. Keep in mind that the space charge width is a function of the reverse-biased voltage so that the junction capacitance is also a function of the reverse-biased voltage applied to the pn junction.\n\n### 7.3.3 One-Sided Junctions\n\nConsider a special pn junction called the one-sided junction.

    "text": "## 7.4 | JUNCTION BREAKDOWN\n\nIn the last section, we determined the effects of applying a reverse-biased voltage across the pn junction. However, the reverse-biased voltage may not increase without limit; at some particular voltage, the reverse-biased current will increase rapidly. The applied voltage at this point is called the **breakdown voltage**.\n\nTwo physical mechanisms give rise to the reverse-biased breakdown in a pn junction: the **Zener effect** and the **avalanche effect**. Zener breakdown occurs in highly doped pn junctions through a tunneling mechanism. In a highly doped junction, the conduction and valence bands on opposite sides of the junction are sufficiently close during reverse bias that electrons may tunnel directly from the valence band on the p side into the conduction band on the n side. This tunneling process is schematically shown in Figure 7.12a.\n\nThe avalanche breakdown process occurs when electrons and/or holes, moving across the space charge region, acquire sufficient energy from the electric field to create electron–hole pairs by colliding with atomic electrons within the depletion region. The avalanche process is schematically shown in Figure 7.12b. The newly\n\n**Figure 7.12** (a) Zener breakdown mechanism in a reverse-biased pn junction; (b) avalanche breakdown process in a reverse-biased pn junction.\n\n\n**Figure 7.13** Electron and hole current components through the space charge region during avalanche multiplication.\n\nCreated electrons and holes move in opposite directions due to the electric field and thereby create a reverse-biased current. In addition, the newly generated electrons and/or holes may acquire sufficient energy to ionize other atoms, leading to the avalanche process. For most pn junctions, the predominant breakdown mechanism will be the avalanche effect.\n\nIf we assume that a reverse-biased electron current \\( I_{n0} \\) enters the depletion region at \\( x = 0 \\) as shown in Figure 7.13, the electron current \\( I_n \\) will increase with distance through the depletion region due to the avalanche process. At \\( x = W \\), the electron current may be written as\n\n\\[\nI_n(W) = M_n I_{n0}\n\\]\n\n(7.49)\n\nwhere \\( M_n \\) is a multiplication factor. The hole current is increasing through the depletion region from the n to p region and reaches a maximum value at \\( x = 0 \\). The total current is constant through the pn junction in steady state.\n\nWe can write an expression for the incremental electron current at some point \\( x \\) as\n\n\\[\ndI_n(x) = I_n(x) \\alpha_n dx + I_p(x) \\alpha_p dx \\tag{7.50}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha_n \\) and \\( \\alpha_p \\) are the electron and hole ionization rates, respectively.

    "text": "## 7.5 Nonuniformly Doped Junctions\n\nIn the pn junctions considered so far, we have assumed that each semiconductor region has been uniformly doped. In actual pn junction structures, this is rarely true. In some electronic applications, specific nonuniform doping profiles are used to obtain special pn junction capacitance characteristics.\n\n### 7.5.1 Linearly Graded Junctions\n\nIf we start with a uniformly doped n-type semiconductor, for example, and diffuse acceptor atoms through the surface, the impurity concentrations will tend to be like those shown in Figure 7.16. The point at \\( x = x' \\) on the figure corresponds to the metallurgical junction. The depletion region extends into the p and n regions from the metallurgical junction as we have discussed previously. The net p-type doping concentration near the metallurgical junction may be approximated as a linear function of distance from the metallurgical junction. Likewise, as a first approximation, the net n-type doping concentration is also a linear function of distance extending into the n region from the metallurgical junction. This effective doping profile is referred to as a linearly graded junction.\n\nFigure 7.17 shows the space charge density in the depletion region of the linearly graded junction. For convenience, the metallurgical junction is placed at \\( x = 0 \\). The space charge density can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\rho(x) = e\\alpha x\n\\]\n\n(7.62)\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha \\) is the gradient of the net impurity concentration.\n\nThe electric field and potential in the space charge region can be determined from Poisson’s equation. We can write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s} = \\frac{e\\alpha x}{\\varepsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(7.63)\n\nso that the electric field can be found by integration as\n\n\\[\nE = \\int \\frac{e\\alpha x}{\\varepsilon_s} \\, dx = \\frac{e\\alpha}{2\\varepsilon_s} (x^2 - x_0^2)\n\\]\n\n(7.64)\n\nThe electric field in the linearly graded junction is a quadratic function of distance rather than the linear function found in the uniformly doped junction. The maximum electric field again occurs at the metallurgical junction. We may note that the electric field is zero at both \\( x = +x_0 \\) and at \\( x = -x_0 \\). The electric field in a nonuniformly doped junction doped semiconductor is not exactly zero, but the magnitude of this field is small, so setting \\( E = 0 \\) in the bulk regions is still a good approximation.\n\n**Figure 7.16** Impurity concentrations of a pn junction with a nonuniformly doped p region.\n\n**Figure 7.17** Space charge density in a linearly graded pn junction.\n\nThe potential is again found by integrating the electric field as\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = - \\int E \\, dx\n\\]\n\n(7.65)\n\nIf we arbitrarily set \\(\\phi = 0\\) at \\(x = -x_0\\), then the potential through the junction is\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x) = -\\frac{ea}{2\\epsilon_s} \\left( \\frac{x^3}{3} - x_0^2 x \\right) + \\frac{ea}{3\\epsilon_s} x_0^3\n\\]\n\n(7.66)\n\nThe magnitude of the potential at \\(x = +x_0\\) will equal the built-in potential barrier for this function. We then have that\n\n\\[\n\\phi(x_0) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{ea x_0^3}{\\epsilon_s} = V_{bi}\n\\]\n\n(7.67)\n\nAnother expression for the built-in potential barrier for a linearly graded junction can be approximated from the expression used for a uniformly doped junction. We can write\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = V_t \\ln \\left[ \\frac{N_d(x_0) N_a(-x_0)}{n_i^2} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(7.68)\n\nwhere \\(N_d(x_0)\\) and \\(N_a(-x_0)\\) are the doping concentrations at the edges of the space charge region. We can relate these doping concentrations to the gradient, so that\n\n\\[\nN_d(x_0) = ax_0\n\\]\n\n(7.69a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nN_a(-x_0) = ax_0\n\\]\n\n(7.69b)\n\nThen the built-in potential barrier for the linearly graded junction becomes\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = V_t \\ln \\left( \\frac{(ax_0)^2}{n_i^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(7.70)\n\nThere may be situations in which the doping gradient is not the same on either side of the junction, but we will not consider that condition here.\n\nIf a reverse-biased voltage is applied to the junction, the potential barrier increases. The built-in potential barrier \\(V_{bi}\\) in the above equations is then replaced by the total potential barrier \\(V_{bi} + V_R\\). Solving for \\(x_0\\) from Equation (7.67) and using the total potential barrier, we obtain\n\n\\[\nx_0 = \\left[ \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon_s}{ea} (V_{bi} + V_R) \\right]^{1/3}\n\\]\n\n(7.71)\n\nThe junction capacitance per unit area can be determined by the same method that we used for the uniformly doped junction. Figure 7.18 shows the differential charge\n\n**Figure 7.18** Differential change in space charge width with a differential change in reverse-biased voltage for a linearly graded pn junction.\n\n\\( dQ' \\), which is uncovered as a differential voltage \\( dV_R \\) is applied. The junction capacitance is then\n\n\\[\nC' = \\frac{dQ'}{dV_R} = (ea\\alpha) \\frac{dx_0}{dV_R}\n\\]\n\n(7.72)\n\nUsing Equation (7.71), we obtain\\(^1\\)\n\n\\[\nC' = \\left\\{ \\frac{ea\\epsilon^2}{12(V_{bi} + V_R)} \\right\\}^{1/3}\n\\]\n\n(7.73)\n\nWe may note that \\( C' \\) is proportional to \\( (V_{bi} + V_R)^{-1/3} \\) for the linearly graded junction as compared to \\( C' \\propto (V_{bi} + V_R)^{-1/2} \\) for the uniformly doped junction. In the linearly graded junction, the capacitance is less dependent on reverse-biased voltage than in the uniformly doped junction.\n\n### 7.5.2 Hyperabrupt Junctions\n\nThe uniformly doped junction and linearly graded junction are not the only possible doping profiles. Figure 7.19 shows a generalized one-sided p\\(^+\\)n junction where the generalized n-type doping concentration for \\( x > 0 \\) is given by\n\n\\[\nN = Bx^m\n\\]\n\n(7.74)\n\nThe case of \\( m = 0 \\) corresponds to the uniformly doped junction, and \\( m = +1 \\) corresponds to the linearly graded junction just discussed. The cases of \\( m = +2 \\) and \\( m = +3 \\) would approximate a fairly low-doped epitaxial n-type layer grown\n\n\n\\(^1\\)In a more exact analysis, \\( V_R \\) in Equation (7.73) is replaced by a gradient voltage. However, this analysis is beyond the scope of this text.\n\n*Figure 7.19* Generalized doping profiles of a one-sided p\\(^+\\)n junction.  \n(From Sze [14].)\n\n\nOn a much more heavily doped n\\(^+\\) substrate layer. When the value of \\(m\\) is negative, we have what is referred to as a **hyperabrupt junction**. In this case, the n-type doping is larger near the metallurgical junction than in the bulk semiconductor. Equation (7.74) is used to approximate the n-type doping over a small region near \\(x = x_0\\) and does not hold at \\(x = 0\\) when \\(m\\) is negative.\n\nThe junction capacitance can be derived using the same analysis method as before and is given by\n\n\\[\nC' = \\left( \\frac{eB\\epsilon (m+1)}{(m + 2)\\sqrt{V_{bi} + V}} \\right)^{1/(m+2)}\n\\]\n\n(7.75)\n\nWhen \\(m\\) is negative, the capacitance becomes a very strong function of reverse-biased voltage, a desired characteristic in **varactor diodes**. The term varactor comes from the words **variable reactor** and means a device whose reactance can be varied in a controlled manner with bias voltage.\n\nIf a varactor diode and an inductance are in parallel, the resonant frequency of the LC circuit is\n\n\\[\nf_r = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}\n\\]\n\n(7.76)\n\nThe capacitance of the diode, from Equation (7.75), can be written in the form\n\n\\[\nC = C_0(V_{bi} + V_R)^{-1/(m+2)}\n\\]\n\n(7.77)\n\nIn a circuit application, we would, in general, like to have the resonant frequency be a linear function of reverse-biased voltage \\( V_R \\), so we need\n\n\\[\nC \\propto V^{-2}\n\\]\n\n(7.78)\n\nFrom Equation (7.77), the parameter \\( m \\) required is found from\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m + 2} = 2\n\\]\n\n(7.79a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n(7.79b)\n\nA specific doping profile will yield the desired capacitance characteristic.",

    "text": "## 7.6 Summary\n\n- A uniformly doped pn junction is initially considered, in which one region of a semiconductor is uniformly doped with acceptor impurities and the adjacent region is uniformly doped with donor impurities.\n- A space charge region, or depletion region, is formed on either side of the metallurgical junction separating the n and p regions. This region is essentially depleted of any mobile electrons or holes. A net positive charge density, due to the positively charged donor impurity ions, exists in the n region and a net negative charge density, due to the negatively charged acceptor impurity ions, exists in the p region.\n- An electric field exists in the depletion region due to the net space charge density. The direction of the electric field is from the n region to the p region.\n- A potential difference exists across the space charge region. Under zero applied bias, this potential difference, known as the built-in potential barrier, maintains thermal equilibrium and holds back majority carrier electrons in the n region and majority carrier holes in the p region.\n- An applied reverse-biased voltage (n region positive with respect to the p region) increases the potential barrier, the space charge width, and the magnitude of the electric field.\n- As the reverse-biased voltage changes, the amount of charge in the depletion region changes. This change in charge with voltage defines the junction capacitance.\n- Avalanche breakdown occurs when a sufficiently large reverse-biased voltage is applied to the pn junction. A large reverse-biased current may then be induced in the pn junction. The breakdown voltage, as a function of the doping concentrations in the pn junction, is derived. In a one-sided pn junction, the breakdown voltage is a function of the doping concentration in the low-doped region.\n- The linearly graded junction represents a nonuniformly doped pn junction. Expressions for the electric field, built-in potential barrier, and junction capacitance are derived. The functional relationships differ from those of the uniformly doped junction.\n- Specific doping profiles can be used to obtain specific capacitance characteristics. A hyperabrupt junction is one in which the doping decreases away from the metallurgical junction. This type of junction is advantageous in varactor diodes that are used in resonant circuits.",

    "text": "## 2.1 Principles of Quantum Mechanics\n\nBefore we delve into the mathematics of quantum mechanics, there are three principles we need to consider: the principle of energy quanta, the wave–particle duality principle, and the uncertainty principle.\n\n### 2.1.1 Energy Quanta\n\nOne experiment that demonstrates an inconsistency between experimental results and the classical theory of light is called the photoelectric effect. If monochromatic light is incident on a clean surface of a material, then under certain conditions, electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from the surface. According to classical physics, if the intensity of the light is large enough, the work function of the material will be overcome and an electron will be emitted from the surface independent of the incident frequency. This result is not observed. The observed effect is that at a constant incident intensity, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron varies linearly with frequency with a limiting frequency \\( \\nu = \\nu_0 \\), below which no photoelectron is produced. This result is shown in Figure 2.1. If the incident intensity varies at a constant frequency, the rate of photoelectron emission changes, but the maximum kinetic energy remains the same.\n\nPlanck postulated in 1900 that thermal radiation is emitted from a heated surface in discrete packets of energy called quanta. The energy of these quanta is given by \\( E = h\\nu \\) where \\( \\nu \\) is the frequency of the radiation and \\( h \\) is a constant now known as Planck’s constant (\\( h = 6.625 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J·s} \\)). Then in 1905, Einstein interpreted the photoelectric results by suggesting that the energy in a light wave is also contained in quanta.\n\n\n**Figure 2.1** (a) The photoelectric effect and (b) the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron as a function of incident frequency.\n\n- **(a)** Incident monochromatic light on a material results in photoelectron kinetic energy \\( T \\).\n- **(b)** Graph showing maximum kinetic energy \\( T_{\\text{max}} \\) versus frequency \\( \\nu \\).\n\nIn discrete packets or bundles, the particle-like packet of energy is called a **photon**, whose energy is also given by \\( E = h\\nu \\). A photon with sufficient energy, then, can knock an electron from the surface of the material. The minimum energy required to remove an electron is called the **work function** of the material and any excess photon energy goes into the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. This result was confirmed experimentally as demonstrated in Figure 2.1. The photoelectric effect shows the discrete nature of the photon and demonstrates the particle-like behavior of the photon.\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron can be written as\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = h\\nu - \\Phi = h\\nu - h\\nu_0 \\quad (\\nu \\geq \\nu_0)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Phi = h\\nu_0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h\\nu \\) is the incident photon energy and \\( \\Phi = h\\nu_0 \\) is the minimum energy, or work function, required to remove an electron from the surface.\n\n### 2.1.2 Wave–Particle Duality\n\nWe have seen in the last section that light waves, in the photoelectric effect, behave as if they are particles. The particle-like behavior of electromagnetic waves was also instrumental in the explanation of the **Compton effect**. In this experiment, an x-ray beam was incident on a solid. A portion of the x-ray beam was deflected and the frequency of the deflected wave had shifted compared with the incident wave. The observed change in frequency and the deflected angle corresponded exactly to the expected results of a \"billiard ball\" collision between an x-ray quanta, or photon, and an electron in which both energy and momentum are conserved.\n\nIn 1924, de Broglie postulated the existence of matter waves. He suggested that since waves exhibit particle-like behavior, particles should be expected to show wave-like properties. The hypothesis of de Broglie was the existence of a **wave-particle duality principle**. The momentum of a photon is given by\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light wave. Then, de Broglie hypothesized that the wavelength of a particle can be expressed as\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the momentum of the particle and \\(\\lambda\\) is known as the **de Broglie wavelength** of the matter wave.\n\nThe wave nature of electrons has been tested in several ways. In one experiment by Davisson and Germer in 1927, electrons from a heated filament were accelerated at normal incidence onto a single crystal of nickel. A detector measured the scattered electrons as a function of angle. Figure 2.2 shows the experimental setup and Figure 2.3 shows the results. The existence of a peak in the density of scattered electrons can be explained as a constructive interference of waves scattered by the periodic atoms in the planes of the nickel crystal. The angular distribution is very similar to an interference pattern produced by light diffracted from a grating.\n\nIn order to gain some appreciation of the frequencies and wavelengths involved in the wave-particle duality principle, Figure 2.4 shows the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. We see that a wavelength of 72.7 Å obtained in the next example is in the ultraviolet range. Typically, we will be considering wavelengths in the ultraviolet and visible range. These wavelengths are very short compared to the usual radio spectrum range.¹\n\n\n**Figure 2.2** | Experimental arrangement of the Davisson–Germer experiment.\n\n**Figure 2.3** | Scattered electron flux as a function of scattering angle for the Davisson–Germer experiment.\n\n| λ (μm) | 0.001 | 0.20 | 0.39 | 0.49 | 0.55 | 0.577 | 0.62 | 0.77 | 1.5 | 6.0 | 40 | 1000 |\n|--------|-------|------|------|------|------|-------|------|------|-----|-----|----|------|\n|        | Extreme | Far | Near | Violet | Blue | Yellow | Orange | Red | Near | Medium | Far | Extreme |\n|        |         |     |      | 0.455 | 0.492 | 0.527 | 0.622 | 0.770 |     |     |    |      |\n\n| Wavelength (m) | 1 fm | 1 pm | 1 Å | 1 nm | 1 μm | 1 mm | 1 m | 1 km | 1 Mm |\n|----------------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-----|------|------|\n|                | 10^-15 | 10^-12 | 10^-10 | 10^-9 | 10^-6 | 10^-3 | 1 | 10^3 | 10^6 |\n\n| Frequency (Hz) | 1 THz | 1 GHz | 1 MHz | 1 kHz | 1 Hz |\n|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|\n|                | 10^12 | 10^9 | 10^6 | 10^3 | 1 |\n\n¹An electron microscope is a microscope that produces a magnified image of a specimen. The electron microscope has a magnification approximately 1000 times that of an optical microscope, because the electrons have wavelengths on the order of 100,000 times shorter than the light waves.\n\n### 2.1.3 The Uncertainty Principle\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle, given in 1927, also applies primarily to very small particles and states that we cannot describe with absolute accuracy the behavior of these subatomic particles. The uncertainty principle describes a fundamental relationship between conjugate variables, including position and momentum and also energy and time.\n\nThe first statement of the uncertainty principle is that it is impossible to simultaneously describe with absolute accuracy the position and momentum of a particle. If the uncertainty in the momentum is \\(\\Delta p\\) and the uncertainty in the position is \\(\\Delta x\\), then the uncertainty principle is stated as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p \\Delta x \\geq \\hbar\n\\]\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \\(\\hbar\\) is defined as \\(\\hbar = h/2\\pi = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J-s}\\) and is called a modified Planck’s constant. This statement may be generalized to include angular position and angular momentum.\n\nThe second statement of the uncertainty principle is that it is impossible to simultaneously describe with absolute accuracy the energy of a particle and the instant of time the particle has this energy. Again, if the uncertainty in the energy is given by \\(\\Delta E\\) and the uncertainty in the time is given by \\(\\Delta t\\), then the uncertainty principle is stated as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\hbar\n\\]\n\n(2.5)\n\nOne way to visualize the uncertainty principle is to consider the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum, and the simultaneous measurement of energy and time. The uncertainty principle implies that these simultaneous measurements are in error to a certain extent. However, the modified Planck’s constant \\(\\hbar\\) is very small; the uncertainty principle is only significant for subatomic particles. We must keep in mind nevertheless that the uncertainty principle is a fundamental statement and does not deal only with measurements.\n\nOne consequence of the uncertainty principle is that we cannot, for example, determine the exact position of an electron. We will, instead, determine the probability of finding an electron at a particular position. In later chapters, we will develop a\n\n\n*In some texts, the uncertainty principle is stated as \\(\\Delta p \\Delta x \\approx \\hbar/2\\). We are interested here in the order of magnitude and will not be concerned with small differences.*\n\nprobability density function that will allow us to determine the probability that an electron has a particular energy. So in describing electron behavior, we will be dealing with probability functions.",

    "text": "## 2.2 SCHRODINGER’S WAVE EQUATION\n\nThe various experimental results involving electromagnetic waves and particles, which could not be explained by classical laws of physics, showed that a revised formulation of mechanics was required. Schrödinger, in 1926, provided a formulation called wave mechanics, which incorporated the principles of quanta introduced by Planck, and the wave–particle duality principle introduced by de Broglie. On the basis of wave–particle duality principle, we will describe the motion of electrons in a crystal by wave theory. This wave theory is described by Schrödinger’s wave equation.\n\n### 2.2.1 The Wave Equation\n\nThe one-dimensional, nonrelativistic Schrödinger’s wave equation is given by\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Psi(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} + V(x)\\Psi(x, t) = j\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(x, t)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere \\(\\Psi(x, t)\\) is the wave function, \\(V(x)\\) is the potential function assumed to be independent of time, \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle, and \\(j\\) is the imaginary constant \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\). There are theoretical arguments that justify the form of Schrödinger’s wave equation, but the equation is a basic postulate of quantum mechanics. The wave function \\(\\Psi(x, t)\\) will be used to describe the behavior of the system and, mathematically, \\(\\Psi(x, t)\\) can be a complex quantity.\n\nWe may determine the time-dependent portion of the wave function and the position-dependent, or time-independent, portion of the wave function by using the technique of separation of variables. Assume that the wave function can be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\Psi(x, t) = \\psi(x)\\phi(t)\n\\]\n\n(2.7)\n\n\nwhere \\( \\psi(x) \\) is a function of the position \\( x \\) only and \\( \\Phi(t) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) only. Substituting this form of the solution into Schrödinger’s wave equation, we obtain\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\Phi(x) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + V(x) \\psi(x) \\Phi(t) = j\\hbar \\psi(x) \\frac{\\partial \\Phi(t)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(2.8)\n\nIf we **divide by the total wave function**, Equation (2.8) becomes\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{1}{\\psi(x)} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + V(x) = j\\hbar \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\Phi(t)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\Phi(t)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(2.9)\n\nSince the left side of Equation (2.9) is a function of position \\( x \\) only and the right side of the equation is a function of time \\( t \\) only, each side of this equation must be equal to a constant. We will denote this separation of variables constant by \\( \\eta \\).\n\nThe time-dependent portion of Equation (2.9) is then written as\n\n\\[\n\\eta = j\\hbar \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\Phi(t)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\Phi(t)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere again the parameter \\( \\eta \\) is called a separation constant. **The solution of Equation (2.10) can be written in the form**\n\n\\[\n\\Phi(t) = e^{-j\\eta t/\\hbar}\n\\]\n\n(2.11a)\n\nThe form of this solution is the classical exponential form of a sinusoidal wave. We have that \\( E = h\\nu \\) or \\( E = h\\omega/2\\pi \\). Then \\( \\omega = \\eta/\\hbar = E/\\hbar \\) so that the separation constant is equal to the total energy \\( E \\) of the particle.\n\nWe can then write\n\n\\[\n\\Phi(t) = e^{-jEt/\\hbar} = e^{-j\\omega t}\n\\]\n\n(2.11b)\n\nWe see that \\( \\omega = E/\\hbar \\) and is the radian or angular frequency of the sinusoidal wave.\n\nThe time-independent portion of Schrödinger’s wave equation can now be written from Equation (2.9) as\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\psi(x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + V(x) = E\n\\]\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere the separation constant is the total energy \\( E \\) of the particle. Equation (2.12) may be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} (E - V(x)) \\psi(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere again \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle, \\( V(x) \\) is the potential experienced by the particle, and \\( E \\) is the total energy of the particle. **This time-independent Schrödinger’s wave equation can also be justified on the basis of the classical wave equation as shown in Appendix E.** The pseudo-derivation in the appendix is a simple approach but shows the plausibility of the time-independent Schrödinger’s equation.\n\n### 2.2.2 Physical Meaning of the Wave Function\n\nWe are ultimately trying to use the wave function \\( \\Psi(x, t) \\) to describe the behavior of an electron in a crystal. The function \\( \\Psi(x, t) \\) is a wave function, so it is reasonable to ask what the relation is between the function and the electron. The total wave function is the product of the position-dependent, or time-independent, function and the time-dependent function. From Equation (2.7) we have\n\n\\[\n\\Psi(x, t) = \\psi(x)\\phi(t) = \\psi(x)e^{-iEt/\\hbar} = \\psi(x)e^{-i\\omega t}\n\\]\n\n(2.14)\n\nSince the total wave function \\(\\Psi(x, t)\\) is a complex function, it cannot by itself represent a real physical quantity.\n\nMax Born postulated in 1926 that the function \\(|\\Psi(x, t)|^2 \\, dx\\) is the probability of finding the particle between \\(x\\) and \\(x + dx\\) at a given time, or that \\(|\\Psi(x, t)|^2\\) is a probability density function. We have that\n\n\\[\n|\\Psi(x, t)|^2 = \\Psi(x, t) \\cdot \\Psi^*(x, t)\n\\]\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere \\(\\Psi^*(x, t)\\) is the complex conjugate function. Therefore\n\n\\[\n\\Psi^*(x, t) = \\psi^*(x) \\cdot e^{iEt/\\hbar}\n\\]\n\nThen the product of the total wave function and its complex conjugate is given by\n\n\\[\n\\Psi(x, t)\\Psi^*(x, t) = [\\psi(x)e^{-iEt/\\hbar}] [\\psi^*(x)e^{iEt/\\hbar}] = \\psi(x)\\psi^*(x)\n\\]\n\n(2.16)\n\nTherefore, we have that\n\n\\[\n|\\Psi(x, t)|^2 = \\psi(x)\\psi^*(x) = |\\psi(x)|^2\n\\]\n\n(2.17)\n\nis the probability density function and is independent of time. One major difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that in classical mechanics, the position of a particle or body can be determined precisely, whereas in quantum mechanics, the position of a particle is found in terms of a probability. We will determine the probability density function for several examples, and since this property is independent of time, we will, in general, only be concerned with the time-independent wave function.\n\n### 2.2.3 Boundary Conditions\n\nSince the function \\(|\\psi(x)|^2\\) represents the probability density function, then for a single particle, we must have\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, dx = 1\n\\]\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle somewhere is certain. Equation (2.18) allows us to normalize the wave function and is one boundary condition that is used to determine some wave function coefficients.\n\nThe remaining boundary conditions imposed on the wave function and its derivative are postulates. However, we may state the boundary conditions and present arguments that justify why they must be imposed. The wave function and its first derivative must have the following properties if the total energy \\(E\\) and the potential \\(V(x)\\) are finite everywhere.\n\n- **Condition 1.** \\(\\psi(x)\\) must be finite, single-valued, and continuous.\n- **Condition 2.** \\(\\frac{\\partial \\psi(x)}{\\partial x}\\) must be finite, single-valued, and continuous.\n\n**Figure 2.5** Potential functions and corresponding wave function solutions for the case (a) when the potential function is finite everywhere and (b) when the potential function is infinite in some regions.\n\nSince \\(|\\psi(x)|^2\\) is a probability density, then \\(\\psi(x)\\) must be finite and single-valued. If the probability density were to become infinite at some point in space, then the probability of finding the particle at this position would be certain and the uncertainty principle would be violated. If the total energy \\(E\\) and the potential \\(V(x)\\) are finite everywhere, then from Equation (2.13), the second derivative must be finite, which implies that the first derivative must be continuous. The first derivative is related to the particle momentum, which must be finite and single-valued. Finally, a finite first derivative implies that the function itself must be continuous. In some of the specific examples that we will consider, the potential function will become infinite in particular regions of space. For these cases, the first derivative will not necessarily be continuous, but the remaining boundary conditions will still hold.\n\nFigure 2.5 shows two possible examples of potential functions and the corresponding wave solutions. In Figure 2.5a, the potential function is finite everywhere. The wave function as well as its first derivative is continuous. In Figure 2.5b, the potential function is infinite for \\(x < 0\\) and for \\(x > a\\). The wave function is continuous at the boundaries, but the first derivative is discontinuous. We will actually determine the wave functions in the following sections and in end-of-chapter problems.",

    "text": "## 2.3 APPLICATIONS OF SCHRODINGER’S WAVE EQUATION\n\nWe will now apply Schrodinger’s wave equation in several examples using various potential functions. These examples will demonstrate the techniques used in the solution of Schrodinger’s differential equation and the results of these examples will provide an indication of the electron behavior under these various potentials.\n\nWe will utilize the resulting concepts later in the discussion of semiconductor properties.\n\n### 2.3.1 Electron in Free Space\n\nAs a first example of applying the Schrödinger's wave equation, consider the motion of an electron in free space. If there is no force acting on the particle, then the potential function \\( V(x) \\) will be constant and we must have \\( E > V(x) \\). Assume, for simplicity, that the potential function \\( V(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\). Then, the time-independent wave equation can be written from Equation (2.13) as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} \\psi(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.19)\n\nThe solution to this differential equation can be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) = A \\exp \\left( j \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar} x \\right) + B \\exp \\left( -j \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar} x \\right)\n\\]\n\n(2.20a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) = A \\exp(jkx) + B \\exp(-jkx)\n\\]\n\n(2.20b)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}\n\\]\n\n(2.21)\n\nand is called a wave number.\n\nRecall that the time-dependent portion of the solution is\n\n\\[\n\\phi(t) = e^{-j\\omega t} = e^{-j\\omega t}\n\\]\n\n(2.22)\n\nThen the total solution for the wave function is given by\n\n\\[\n\\Psi(x, t) = A \\exp[j(kx - \\omega t)] + B \\exp[-j(kx + \\omega t)]\n\\]\n\n(2.23)\n\nThis wave function solution is a traveling wave, which means that a particle moving in free space is represented by a traveling wave. The first term, with the coefficient \\( A \\), is a wave traveling in the \\( +x \\) direction, while the second term, with the coefficient \\( B \\), is a wave traveling in the \\( -x \\) direction. The value of these coefficients will be determined from boundary conditions. We will again see the traveling-wave solution for an electron in a crystal or semiconductor material.\n\nAssume, for a moment, that we have a particle traveling in the \\( +x \\) direction, which will be described by the \\( +x \\) traveling wave. The coefficient \\( B = 0 \\). We can write the traveling-wave solution in the form\n\n\\[\n\\Psi(x, t) = A \\exp[j(kx - \\omega t)]\n\\]\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the wave number given by\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^2}}{\\hbar} = \\frac{p}{\\hbar}\n\\]\n\n(2.25a)\n\n\nor\n\n\\[\np = \\hbar k\n\\]\n(2.25b)\n\nAlso recall that the de Broglie wavelength was given by\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{2\\pi \\hbar}{p}\n\\]\n(2.26)\n\nCombining Equations (2.25a) and (2.26), the wavelength can also be written in terms of the wave number as\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}\n\\]\n(2.27a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\n\\]\n(2.27b)\n\nA free particle with a well-defined energy will also have a well-defined wavelength and momentum.\n\nThe probability density function is \\(\\Psi(x, t)\\Psi^*(x, t) = A A^*\\), which is a constant independent of position. A free particle with a well-defined momentum can be found anywhere with equal probability. This result is in agreement with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in which a precise momentum implies an undefined position.\n\nA localized free particle is defined by a wave packet, formed by a superposition of wave functions with different momentum or \\(k\\) values. We will not consider the wave packet here.\n\n### 2.3.2 The Infinite Potential Well\n\nThe problem of a particle in the infinite potential well is a classic example of a bound particle. The potential \\(V(x)\\) as a function of position for this problem is shown in Figure 2.6. The particle is assumed to exist in region II, so the particle is contained within a finite region of space. The time-independent Schrödinger’s wave equation is again given by Equation (2.13) as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} (E - V(x))\\psi(x) = 0\n\\]\n(2.13)\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the total energy of the particle. If \\(E\\) is finite, the wave function must be zero, or \\(\\psi(x) = 0\\), in both regions I and III. A particle cannot penetrate these infinite potential barriers, so the probability of finding the particle in regions I and III is zero.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger’s wave equation in region II, where \\(V = 0\\), becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} \\psi(x) = 0\n\\]\n(2.28)\n\n**Figure 2.6** Potential function of the infinite potential well.\n\nA particular form of solution to this equation is given by\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) = A_1 \\cos kx + A_2 \\sin kx\n\\]\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}}\n\\]\n\n(2.30)\n\nOne boundary condition is that the wave function \\(\\psi(x)\\) must be continuous so that\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x = 0) = \\psi(x = a) = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.31)\n\nApplying the boundary condition at \\(x = 0\\), we must have that \\(A_1 = 0\\). At \\(x = a\\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x = a) = 0 = A_2 \\sin ka\n\\]\n\n(2.32)\n\nThis equation is valid if \\(ka = n\\pi\\), where the parameter \\(n\\) is a positive integer, or \\(n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\). The parameter \\(n\\) is referred to as a quantum number. We can write\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{n\\pi}{a}\n\\]\n\n(2.33)\n\nNegative values of \\(n\\) simply introduce a negative sign in the wave function and yield redundant solutions for the probability density function. We cannot physically distinguish any difference between \\(+n\\) and \\(-n\\) solutions. Because of this redundancy, negative values of \\(n\\) are not considered.\n\nThe coefficient \\(A_2\\) can be found from the normalization boundary condition that was given by Equation (2.18) as \\(\\int_0^a \\psi^*(x) \\psi(x) \\, dx = 1\\). If we assume that the wave\n\n\nIf the function solution \\(\\psi(x)\\) is a real function, then \\(\\psi(x) = \\psi^*(x)\\). Substituting the wave function into Equation (2.18), we have\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^a A_2^2 \\sin^2 kx \\, dx = 1\n\\]\n\n(2.34)\n\nEvaluating this integral gives\n\n\\[\nA_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}}\n\\]\n\n(2.35)\n\nFinally, the time-independent wave solution is given by\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin \\left( \\frac{n \\pi x}{a} \\right) \\quad \\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n(2.36)\n\nThis solution represents the electron in the infinite potential well and is a standing wave solution. The free electron was represented by a traveling wave, and now the bound particle is represented by a standing wave.\n\nThe parameter \\(k\\) in the wave solution was defined by Equations (2.30) and (2.33). Equating these two expressions for \\(k\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2}{a^2}\n\\]\n\n(2.37)\n\nThe total energy can then be written as\n\n\\[\nE = E_n = \\frac{\\hbar^2 n^2 \\pi^2}{2ma^2} \\quad \\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n(2.38)\n\nFor the particle in the infinite potential well, the wave function is now given by\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin k_n x\n\\]\n\n(2.39)\n\nwhere the constant \\(k_n\\), from Equation (2.37), must have discrete values, implying that the total energy of the particle can only have discrete values. This result means that the energy of the particle is quantized. That is, the energy of the particle can only have particular discrete values. The quantization of the particle energy is contrary to results from classical physics, which would allow the particle to have continuous energy values. The discrete energies lead to quantum states that will be considered in more detail in this and later chapters. The quantization of the energy of a bound particle is an important result.\n\nThis quantization of electron energy will be observed again at the end of the chapter for an electron bound to an ion forming an atom.\n\n\n^3 A more thorough analysis shows that \\(|A_2| = \\sqrt{2/a}\\), so solutions for the coefficient \\(A\\) include \\(+\\sqrt{2/a}, -\\sqrt{2/a}, +i\\sqrt{2/a}, -i\\sqrt{2/a}\\), or any complex number whose magnitude is \\(\\sqrt{2/a}\\). Since the wave function itself has no physical meaning, the choice of which coefficient to use is immaterial: They all produce the same probability density function.\n\nFigure 2.7a shows the first four allowed energies for the particle in the infinite potential well, and Figure 2.7b,c shows the corresponding wave functions and probability functions. We may note that as the energy increases, the probability of finding the particle at any given value of \\( x \\) becomes more uniform.\n\n### 2.3.3 The Step Potential Function\n\nConsider now a **step potential function** as shown in Figure 2.8. In the previous section, we considered a particle being confined between two potential barriers. In this example, we will assume that a flux of particles is incident on the potential barrier. We will assume that the particles are traveling in the \\( +x \\) direction and that they originated at \\( x = -\\infty \\). A particularly interesting result is obtained for the case when the total energy of the particle is less than the barrier height, or \\( E < V_0 \\).\n\nWe again need to consider the time-independent wave equation in each of the two regions. This general equation was given in Equation (2.13) as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} (E - V(x)) \\psi(x) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe wave equation in region I, in which \\( V = 0 \\), is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi_I(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} \\psi_I(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.40)\n\n\n[^4]: See Appendix D for a discussion of the electron-volt (eV) as a unit of energy.\n\n\n\n**Figure 2.7** | Particle in an infinite potential well: (a) four lowest discrete energy levels, (b) corresponding wave functions, and (c) corresponding probability functions. (From Pierret [10].)\n\nThe general solution to this equation can be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\psi_I(x) = A e^{j k_1 x} + B e^{-j k_1 x} \\quad (x \\leq 0)\n\\]\n\n(2.41)\n\nwhere the constant \\( k_1 \\) is\n\n\\[\nk_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}}\n\\]\n\n(2.42)\n\nThe first term in Equation (2.41) is a traveling wave in the \\( +x \\) direction that represents the incident wave, and the second term is a traveling wave in the \\( -x \\) direction.\n\n**Figure 2.8** | The step potential function.\n\nFor the incident wave, \\( A_1 \\cdot A_1^* \\) is the probability density function of the incident particles. If we multiply this probability density function by the incident velocity, then \\( v_1 \\cdot A_1 \\cdot A_1^* \\) is the flux of incident particles in units of \\#/cm\\(^2\\)-s. Likewise, the quantity \\( v_1 \\cdot B_1 \\cdot B_1^* \\) is the flux of the reflected particles, where \\( v_1 \\) is the velocity of the reflected wave. (The parameters \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_1 \\) in these terms are actually the magnitudes of the velocity only.)\n\nIn region II, the potential is \\( V = V_0 \\). If we assume that \\( E < V_0 \\), then the differential equation describing the wave function in region II can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi_2(x)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} (V_0 - E) \\psi_2(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.43)\n\nThe general solution may then be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\psi_2(x) = A_2 e^{-k_2 x} + B_2 e^{k_2 x} \\quad (x \\geq 0)\n\\]\n\n(2.44)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nk_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m(V_0 - E)}{\\hbar^2}}\n\\]\n\n(2.45)\n\nOne boundary condition is that the wave function \\( \\psi_2(x) \\) must remain finite, which means that the coefficient \\( B_2 = 0 \\). The wave function is now given by\n\n\\[\n\\psi_2(x) = A_2 e^{-k_2 x} \\quad (x \\geq 0)\n\\]\n\n(2.46)\n\nThe wave function at \\( x = 0 \\) must be continuous so that\n\n\\[\n\\psi_1(0) = \\psi_2(0)\n\\]\n\n(2.47)\n\nThen from Equations (2.41), (2.46), and (2.47), we obtain\n\n\\[\nA_1 + B_1 = A_2\n\\]\n\n(2.48)\n\nSince the potential function is everywhere finite, the first derivative of the wave function must also be continuous so that\n\n\\[\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial \\psi_1}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\psi_2}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0}\n\\]\n\n(2.49)\n\nUsing Equations (2.41), (2.46), and (2.49), we obtain\n\n\\[\njk_1 A_1 - jk_1 B_1 = -k_2 A_2\n\\]\n\n(2.50)\n\nWe can solve Equations (2.48) and (2.50) to determine the coefficients \\( B_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) in terms of the incident wave coefficient \\( A_1 \\). The results are\n\n\\[\nB_1 = \\left( \\frac{-k_2^2 + 2jk_1 k_2 - k_1^2}{k_2^2 + k_1^2} \\right) \\cdot A_1\n\\]\n\n(2.51a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nA_2 = \\frac{2k_1(k_1 - jk_2)}{k_2^2 + k_1^2} \\cdot A_1\n\\]\n\n(2.51b)\n\nThe reflected probability density function is given by\n\n\\[\nB_i \\cdot B_i^* = \\frac{(k_2^2 - k_1^2 + 2ijk_1k_2)(k_2^2 - k_1^2 - 2jk_1k_2)}{(k_2^2 + k_1^2)^2} \\cdot A_i \\cdot A_i^*\n\\]\n\n(2.52)\n\nWe can define a reflection coefficient, \\( R \\), as the ratio of the reflected flux to the incident flux, which is written as\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{v_r \\cdot B_i \\cdot B_i^*}{v_i \\cdot A_i \\cdot A_i^*}\n\\]\n\n(2.53)\n\nwhere \\( v_i \\) and \\( v_r \\) are the incident and reflected velocities, respectively, of the particles. In region I, \\( V = 0 \\) so that \\( E = T \\), where \\( T \\) is the kinetic energy of the particle. The kinetic energy is given by\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2\n\\]\n\n(2.54)\n\nso that the constant \\( k_i \\), from Equation (2.42) may be written as\n\n\\[\nk_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} mv^2\\right)} = \\sqrt{m^2 \\frac{v^2}{\\hbar^2}} = \\frac{mv}{\\hbar}\n\\]\n\n(2.55)\n\nThe incident velocity can then be written as\n\n\\[\nv_i = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\cdot k_i\n\\]\n\n(2.56)\n\nSince the reflected particle also exists in region I, the reflected velocity (magnitude) is given by\n\n\\[\nv_r = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\cdot k_i\n\\]\n\n(2.57)\n\nThe incident and reflected velocities (magnitudes) are equal. The reflection coefficient is then\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{v_r \\cdot B_i \\cdot B_i^*}{v_i \\cdot A_i \\cdot A_i^*} = \\frac{B_i \\cdot B_i^*}{A_i \\cdot A_i^*}\n\\]\n\n(2.58)\n\nSubstituting the expression from Equation (2.52) into Equation (2.58), we obtain\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{B_i \\cdot B_i^*}{A_i \\cdot A_i^*} = \\frac{k_2^2 - k_1^2}{k_2^2 + k_1^2} + \\frac{4k_1^2k_2^2}{k_2^2 + k_1^2} = 1.0\n\\]\n\n(2.59)\n\nThe result of \\( R = 1 \\) implies that all of the particles incident on the potential barrier for \\( E < V_0 \\) are eventually reflected. Particles are not absorbed or transmitted through the potential barrier. This result is entirely consistent with classical physics and one might ask why we should consider this problem in terms of quantum mechanics. The interesting result is in terms of what happens in region II.\n\nThe wave solution in region II was given by Equation (2.46) as \\( \\psi(x) = A_2 e^{-\\kappa x} \\). The coefficient \\( A_2 \\) from Equation (2.48) is \\( A_2 = A_i + B_i \\), which we derived from the boundary conditions. For the case of \\( E < V_0 \\), the coefficient \\( A_2 \\) is not zero. If \\( A_2 \\) is not zero, then the probability density function \\( \\psi_2(x) \\cdot \\psi_2^*(x) \\) of the particle being found in region II is not equal to zero. This result implies that there is a finite probability of finding the particle in region II.\n\n\n**Probability that the incident particle will penetrate the potential barrier and exist in region II. The probability of a particle penetrating the potential barrier is another difference between classical and quantum mechanics: The quantum mechanical penetration is classically not allowed.** Although there is a finite probability that the particle may penetrate the barrier, since the reflection coefficient in region I is unity, the particle in region II must eventually turn around and move back into region I.\n\nThe case when the total energy of a particle, which is incident on the potential barrier, is greater than the barrier height, or \\(E > V_0\\), is left as an exercise at the end of the chapter.\n\n### 2.3.4 The Potential Barrier and Tunneling\n\nWe now want to consider the potential barrier function, which is shown in Figure 2.9. The more interesting problem, again, is in the case when the total energy of an incident particle is \\( E < V_0 \\). Again assume that we have a flux of incident particles originating on the negative x-axis traveling in the \\( +x \\) direction. As before, we need to solve Schrödinger's time-independent wave equation in each of the three regions. The solutions of the wave equation in regions I, II, and III are given, respectively, as\n\n\\[\n\\psi_1(x) = A_1 e^{jk_1x} + B_1 e^{-jk_1x} \\tag{2.60a}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\psi_2(x) = A_2 e^{k_2x} + B_2 e^{-k_2x} \\tag{2.60b}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\psi_3(x) = A_3 e^{jk_1x} + B_3 e^{-jk_1x} \\tag{2.60c}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nk_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}} \\tag{2.61a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nk_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} (V_0 - E)} \\tag{2.61b}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient \\( B_3 \\) in Equation (2.60c) represents a negative traveling wave in region III. However, once a particle gets into region III, there are no potential changes to cause a reflection; therefore, the coefficient \\( B_3 \\) must be zero. We must keep both exponential terms in Equation (2.60b) since the potential barrier width is finite; that is, neither term will become unbounded. We have four boundary relations for the boundaries at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = a \\) corresponding to the wave function and its first derivative being continuous. We can solve for the four coefficients \\( B_1, A_2, B_2, \\) and \\( A_3 \\) in terms of \\( A_1 \\). The wave solutions in the three regions are shown in Figure 2.10.\n\n*Figure 2.9 | The potential barrier function.*\n\n**Figure 2.10** The wave functions through the potential barrier.\n\nOne particular parameter of interest is the transmission coefficient, in this case defined as the ratio of the transmitted flux in region III to the incident flux in region I. Then the transmission coefficient \\( T \\) is\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{v_t \\cdot A_3 \\cdot A_1^*}{v_i \\cdot A_1 \\cdot A_3^*} = \\frac{A_3 \\cdot A_1^*}{A_1 \\cdot A_3^*}\n\\]\n\n(2.62)\n\nwhere \\( v_t \\) and \\( v_i \\) are the velocities of the transmitted and incident particles, respectively. Since the potential \\( V = 0 \\) in both regions I and III, the incident and transmitted velocities are equal. The transmission coefficient may be determined by solving the boundary condition equations. For the special case when \\( E \\ll V_0 \\), we find that\n\n\\[\nT \\approx 16 \\left( \\frac{E}{V_0} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{E}{V_0} \\right) \\exp(-2ka)\n\\]\n\n(2.63)\n\nEquation (2.63) implies that there is a finite probability that a particle impinging a potential barrier will penetrate the barrier and will appear in region III. This phenomenon is called tunneling and it, too, contradicts classical mechanics. We will see later how this quantum mechanical tunneling phenomenon can be applied to semiconductor device characteristics, such as in the tunnel diode.\n\nAdditional applications of Schrödinger’s wave equation with various one-dimensional potential functions are found in problems at the end of the chapter. Several of these potential functions represent quantum well structures that are found in modern semiconductor devices.",

Consider now the one-electron, or hydrogen, atom potential function. We will only briefly consider the mathematical details and wave function solutions, but the results are interesting and important.\n\n### 2.4.1 The One-Electron Atom\n\nThe nucleus is a heavy, positively charged proton and the electron is a light, negatively charged particle that, in the classical Bohr theory, is revolving around the nucleus. \n\n*The detailed mathematical analysis is beyond the scope of this text, but the results, which are emphasized in this section, are important in the following discussions of semiconductor physics.*\n\nThe potential function is due to the coulomb attraction between the proton and electron and is given by\n\n\\[\nV(r) = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}\n\\]\n\n(2.64)\n\nwhere \\( e \\) is the magnitude of the electronic charge and \\( \\varepsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space. This potential function, although spherically symmetric, leads to a three-dimensional problem in spherical coordinates.\n\nWe may generalize the time-independent Schrödinger’s wave equation to three dimensions by writing\n\n\\[\n\\nabla^2 \\psi(r, \\theta, \\phi) + \\frac{2m_0}{\\hbar^2} (E - V(r)) \\psi(r, \\theta, \\phi) = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.65)\n\nwhere \\( \\nabla^2 \\) is the Laplacian operator and must be written in spherical coordinates for this case. The parameter \\( m_0 \\) is the rest mass of the electron. In spherical coordinates, Schrödinger’s wave equation may be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2 \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( \\sin \\theta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\frac{2m_0}{\\hbar^2} (E - V(r)) \\psi = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.66)\n\nThe solution to Equation (2.66) can be determined by the separation-of-variables technique. We will assume that the solution to the time-independent wave equation can be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r, \\theta, \\phi) = R(r) \\cdot \\Theta(\\theta) \\cdot \\Phi(\\phi)\n\\]\n\n(2.67)\n\nwhere \\( R \\), \\( \\Theta \\), and \\( \\Phi \\) are functions only of \\( r \\), \\( \\theta \\), and \\( \\phi \\), respectively. Substituting this form of solution into Equation (2.66), we will obtain\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\theta \\left[ \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\Theta \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( \\sin \\theta \\frac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\Phi \\sin^2 \\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial \\phi^2} \\right] + r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\cdot \\frac{2m_0}{\\hbar^2} (E - V) = 0\n\\]\n\n(2.68)\n\nWe may note that the second term in Equation (2.68) is a function of \\( \\theta \\) only, whereas all the other terms are functions of either \\( r \\) or \\( \\phi \\). We may then write that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\Phi} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial \\phi^2} = -m^2\n\\]\n\n(2.69)\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is a separation of variables constant. The solution to Equation (2.69) is of the form\n\n\\[\n\\Phi = e^{jm\\phi}\n\\]\n\n(2.70)\n\n*The mass should be the rest mass of the two-particle system, but since the proton mass is much greater than the electron mass, the equivalent mass reduces to that of the electron.*\n\n*Where \\( m \\) means the separation-of-variables constant developed historically. That meaning will be retained here even though there may be some confusion with the electron mass. In general, the mass parameter will be used in conjunction with a subscript.*\n\nSince the wave function must be single-valued, we impose the condition that \\( m \\) is an integer, or\n\n\\[\nm = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n(2.71)\n\nIncorporating the separation-of-variables constant, we can further separate the variables \\(\\theta\\) and \\(r\\) and generate two additional separation-of-variables constants \\(l\\) and \\(n\\). The separation-of-variables constants \\(n, l, m\\) are known as quantum numbers. The parameter \\(n\\) is referred to as the principal quantum number, \\(l\\) is the azimuthal or angular quantum number, and \\(m\\) is the magnetic quantum number. The quantum numbers are related by\n\n\\[\nn = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\nl = n - 1, n - 2, n - 3, \\ldots 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|m| = l, (l - 1, \\ldots, 0)\n\\]\n\n(2.72)\n\nEach set of quantum numbers corresponds to a quantum state that the electron may occupy. The electron energy may be written in the form\n\n\\[\nE_n = -\\frac{m_0 e^4}{(4\\pi \\varepsilon_0)^2 2\\hbar^2 n^2}\n\\]\n\n(2.73)\n\nwhere again \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number. The negative energy indicates that the electron is bound to the nucleus and we again see that the energy of the bound electron is quantized. If the energy were to become positive, then the electron would no longer be a bound particle and the total energy would no longer be quantized. Since the parameter \\(n\\) in Equation (2.73) is an integer, the total energy of the electron can take on only discrete values. The quantized energy is again a result of the particle being bound in a finite region of space.\n\nThe solution of the wave equation may be designated by \\(\\psi_{nlm}\\), where \\(n\\), \\(l\\), and \\(m\\) are again the various quantum numbers. For the lowest energy state, \\(n = 1\\), \\(l = 0\\), and \\(m = 0\\), and the wave function is given by\n\n\\[\n\\psi_{100} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{1}{a_0} \\right)^{3/2} e^{-r/a_0}\n\\]\n\n(2.74)\n\nThis function is spherically symmetric, and the parameter \\(a_0\\) is given by\n\n\\[\na_0 = \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_0 e^2} = 0.529 \\, \\text{Å}\n\\]\n\n(2.75)\n\nand is equal to the Bohr radius.\n\nThe radial probability density function, or the probability of finding the electron at a particular distance from the nucleus, is proportional to the product \\(\\psi_{100}^* \\psi_{100}\\) and also to the differential volume of the shell around the nucleus. The probability density function for the lowest energy state is plotted in Figure 2.11a. The most probable distance from the nucleus is at \\(r = a_0\\), which is the same as the Bohr theory. Considering this spherically symmetric probability function, we may now begin to conceive the concept of an electron cloud, or energy shell, surrounding the nucleus rather than a discrete particle orbiting around the nucleus.\n\nThe radial probability density function for the next higher, spherically symmetric wave function, corresponding to \\(n = 2\\), \\(l = 0\\), and \\(m = 0\\), is shown in Figure 2.11b. This figure shows the idea of the next-higher energy shell of the electron. The second energy shell is at a greater radius from the nucleus than the first energy shell. As indicated in the figure, though, there is still a small probability that the electron will exist at the smaller radius. For the case of \\(n = 2\\) and \\(l = 1\\), there are three possible states corresponding to the three allowed values of the quantum number \\(m\\). These wave functions are no longer spherically symmetric.\n\nAlthough we have not gone into a great deal of mathematical detail for the one-electron atom, three results are important for the further analysis of semiconductor materials.\n\n\n**Figure 2.11** The radial probability density function for the one-electron atom in the (a) lowest energy state and (b) next-higher energy state.  \n*(From Eisberg and Resnick [5].)*\n\nThe first is the solution of Schrödinger's wave equation, which again yields electron probability functions, as it did for the simpler potential functions. In developing the physics of semiconductor materials in later chapters, we will also be considering electron probability functions. The second result is the quantization of allowed energy levels for the bound electron. The third is the concept of quantum numbers and quantum states, which evolved from the separation-of-variables technique. We will consider this concept again in the next section and in later chapters when we deal with the semiconductor material physics.\n\n### 2.4.2 The Periodic Table\n\nThe initial portion of the periodic table of elements may be determined by using the results of the one-electron atom plus two additional concepts. The first concept needed is that of **electron spin**. The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, which is quantized and may take on one of two possible values. The spin is designated by a quantum number \\( s \\), which has a value of \\( s = +\\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( s = -\\frac{1}{2} \\). We now have four basic quantum numbers: \\( n, l, m, \\) and \\( s \\).\n\nThe second concept needed is the **Pauli exclusion principle**. The Pauli exclusion principle states that, in any given system (an atom, molecule, or crystal), no two electrons may occupy the same quantum state. In an atom, the exclusion principle means that no two electrons may have the same set of quantum numbers. We will see that the exclusion principle is also an important factor in determining the distribution of electrons among available energy states in a crystal.\n\nTable 2.1 shows the first few elements of the periodic table. For the first element, hydrogen, we have one electron in the lowest energy state corresponding to \\( n = 1 \\). From Equation (2.72) both quantum numbers \\( l \\) and \\( m \\) must be zero. However, the electron can take on either spin factor \\( +\\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\). For helium, two electrons may exist in the lowest energy state. For this case, \\( l = m = 0 \\), so now both electron spin states are occupied and the lowest energy shell is full. The chemical activity of an element is determined primarily by the valence, or outermost, electrons. Since the valence energy shell of helium is full, helium does not react with other elements and is an inert element.\n\n**Table 2.1** Initial portion of the periodic table\n\n| Element  | Notation  | \\( n \\) | \\( l \\) | \\( m \\) | \\( s \\)            |\n|----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|--------------------|\n| Hydrogen | 1s\\(^1\\)  | 1       | 0       | 0       | \\( +\\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| Helium   | 1s\\(^2\\)  | 1       | 0       | 0       | \\( +\\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| Lithium  | 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^1\\) | 2 | 0     | 0       | \\( +\\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| Beryllium| 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^2\\) | 2 | 0     | 0       |                    |\n| Boron    | 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^2\\)2p\\(^1\\) | 2 | 1     | \\( m = 0, -1, +1 \\) | \\( s = +\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| Carbon   | 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^2\\)2p\\(^2\\) | 2 | 1     |                     |                    |\n| Nitrogen | 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^2\\)2p\\(^3\\) | 2 | 1     |                     |                    |\n| Oxygen   | 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^2\\)2p\\(^4\\) | 2 | 1     |                     |                    |\n| Fluorine | 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^2\\)2p\\(^5\\) | 2 | 1     |                     |                    |\n| Neon     | 1s\\(^2\\)2s\\(^2\\)2p\\(^6\\) | 2 | 1     |                     |                    |",

    "text": "## 10.1 THE TWO-TERMINAL MOS STRUCTURE\n\nThe heart of the MOSFET is the MOS capacitor shown in Figure 10.1. The metal may be aluminum or some other type of metal, although in many cases, it is actually a high-conductivity polycrystalline silicon that has been deposited on the oxide; however, the term metal is usually still used. The parameter \\( t_{\\text{ox}} \\) in the figure is the thickness of the oxide and \\( \\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}} \\) is the permittivity of the oxide.\n\n### 10.1.1 Energy-Band Diagrams\n\nThe physics of the MOS structure can be more easily explained with the aid of the simple parallel-plate capacitor. Figure 10.2a shows a parallel-plate capacitor with the top plate at a negative voltage with respect to the bottom plate. An insulator material separates the two plates. With this bias, a negative charge exists on the top plate, a positive charge exists on the bottom plate, and an electric field is induced between the two plates as shown. The capacitance per unit area for this geometry is\n\n\\[\nC' = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{d}\n\\]\n\n(10.1)\n\nwhere \\( \\varepsilon \\) is the permittivity of the insulator and \\( d \\) is the distance between the two plates. The magnitude of the charge per unit area on either plate is\n\n\\[\nQ' = C' V\n\\]\n\n(10.2)\n\n\n**Figure 10.1** The basic MOS capacitor structure.\n\n**Figure 10.2** (a) A parallel-plate capacitor showing the electric field and conductor charges. (b) A corresponding MOS capacitor with a negative gate bias showing the electric field and charge flow. (c) The MOS capacitor with an accumulation layer of holes.\n\n\nwhere the prime indicates charge or capacitance per unit area. The magnitude of the electric field is\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{V}{d}\n\\]\n\n(10.3)\n\nFigure 10.2b shows a MOS capacitor with a p-type semiconductor substrate. The top metal gate is at a negative voltage with respect to the semiconductor substrate. From the example of the parallel-plate capacitor, we can see that a negative charge will exist on the top metal plate and an electric field will be induced with the direction shown in the figure. If the electric field were to penetrate into the semiconductor, the majority carrier holes would experience a force toward the oxide–semiconductor interface. Figure 10.2c shows the equilibrium distribution of charge in the MOS capacitor with this particular applied voltage. An **accumulation layer** of holes at the oxide–semiconductor junction corresponds to the positive charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor.\n\nFigure 10.3a shows the same MOS capacitor in which the polarity of the applied voltage is reversed. A positive charge now exists on the top metal plate and the induced electric field is in the opposite direction as shown. If the electric field penetrates the semiconductor in this case, majority carrier holes will experience a force away from the oxide–semiconductor interface. As the holes are pushed away from\n\nthe interface, a negative space charge region is created because of the fixed ionized acceptor atoms. The negative charge in the induced depletion region corresponds to the negative charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor. Figure 10.3b shows the equilibrium distribution of charge in the MOS capacitor with this applied voltage.\n\nThe energy-band diagrams of the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for various gate biases are shown in Figure 10.4. Figure 10.4a shows the ideal case when zero bias is applied across the MOS device. The energy bands in the semiconductor are flat indicating no net charge exists in the semiconductor. This condition is known as flat band and is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.\n\n\n**Figure 10.3** The MOS capacitor with a moderate positive gate bias, showing (a) the electric field and charge flow and (b) the induced space charge region.\n\n**Figure 10.4** The energy-band diagram of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for (a) a zero applied gate bias showing the ideal case, (b) a negative gate bias, and (c) a moderate positive gate bias.\n- **(a)** Zero voltage applied\n  - Gate\n  - Oxide\n  - p type\n  - Energy levels: \\( E_c, E_{Fi}, E_F, E_v \\)\n\n- **(b)** Negative voltage applied\n  - Gate\n  - Oxide\n  - p type\n  - Accumulation layer of holes\n  - Energy levels: \\( E_c, E_{Fi}, E_F, E_v \\)\n\n- **(c)** Positive voltage applied\n  - Gate\n  - Oxide\n  - p type\n  - Induced space charge region\n  - Energy levels: \\( E_c, E_{Fi}, E_F, E_v \\)\n  - \\( x_d \\)\n\nFigure 10.4b shows the energy-band diagram for the case when a negative bias is applied to the gate. (Remember that positive electron energy is plotted “upward” and positive voltage is plotted “downward.”) The valence-band edge is closer to the Fermi level at the oxide–semiconductor interface than in the bulk material, which implies that there is an accumulation of holes. The semiconductor surface appears to be more p-type than the bulk material. The Fermi level is a constant in the semiconductor since the MOS system is in thermal equilibrium and there is no current through the oxide.\n\nFigure 10.4c shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS system when a positive voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction- and valence-band edges bend as shown in the figure, indicating a space charge region similar to that in a pn junction. The conduction band and intrinsic Fermi levels move closer to the Fermi level. The induced space charge width is \\( x_d \\).\n\nNow consider the case when a still larger positive voltage is applied to the top metal gate of the MOS capacitor. We expect the induced electric field to increase in magnitude and the corresponding positive and negative charges on the MOS capacitor to increase. A larger negative charge in the MOS capacitor implies a larger induced space charge region and more band bending. Figure 10.5 shows such a condition. The intrinsic Fermi level at the surface is now below the Fermi level. The conduction band at the surface is now close to the Fermi level, whereas the valence band is close to the Fermi level in the bulk semiconductor. This result implies that the surface in the semiconductor adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface is n type. By applying a sufficiently large positive gate voltage, we have inverted the surface of the semiconductor from a p-type to an n-type semiconductor. We have created an inversion layer of electrons at the oxide–semiconductor interface.\n\nIn the MOS capacitor structure that we have just considered, we assumed a p-type semiconductor substrate. The same type of energy-band diagrams can be constructed for a MOS capacitor with an n-type semiconductor substrate. Figure 10.6a shows the MOS capacitor structure with a positive voltage applied to the top gate terminal. A positive charge exists on the top gate and an electric field is induced with the direction shown in the figure. An accumulation layer of electrons will be induced in the n-type substrate. The case when a negative voltage is applied to the top gate is shown in Figure 10.6b. A positive space charge region is induced in the n-type semiconductor in this situation.\n\n**Figure 10.5** | The energy-band diagram of the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for a “large” positive gate bias.\n\n- **\\( E_c \\)**: Conduction band edge\n- **\\( E_{Fi} \\)**: Intrinsic Fermi level\n- **\\( E_F \\)**: Fermi level\n- **\\( E_v \\)**: Valence band edge\n  \n**Figure 10.6** The MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate for (a) a positive gate bias and (b) a moderate negative gate bias.\n\nThe energy-band diagrams for this MOS capacitor with the n-type substrate are shown in Figure 10.7. Figure 10.7a shows the case when a positive voltage is applied to the gate and an accumulation layer of electrons is formed. Figure 10.7b shows the energy bands when a negative voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction and valence bands now bend upward indicating that a space charge region has been induced in the n-type substrate. Figure 10.7c shows the energy bands when a larger negative voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction and valence bands are bent even more and the intrinsic Fermi level has moved above the Fermi level. The valence band at the surface is now close to the Fermi level, whereas the conduction band is close to the Fermi level in the bulk semiconductor. This result implies that the semiconductor surface adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface is p type. By applying a sufficiently large negative voltage to the gate of the MOS capacitor, the semiconductor surface has been inverted from n type to p type. An inversion layer of holes has been induced at the oxide–semiconductor interface.\n\n### 10.1.2 Depletion Layer Thickness\n\nWe may calculate the width of the induced space charge region adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface. Figure 10.8 shows the space charge region in a p-type semiconductor substrate. The potential \\( \\phi_p \\) is the difference (in V) between \\( E_{Fi} \\) and \\( E_F \\) and is given by\n\n\\[\n\\phi_p = V_t \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_a}{n_i} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.4)\n\nwhere \\( N_a \\) is the acceptor doping concentration and \\( n_i \\) is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\n\nThe potential \\( \\phi_s \\) is called the surface potential; it is the difference (in V) between \\( E_{Fi} \\) measured in the bulk semiconductor and \\( E_{Fi} \\) measured at the surface. The surface\n\n**Figure 10.7** The energy-band diagram of the MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate for (a) a positive gate bias, (b) a moderate negative bias, and (c) a \"large\" negative gate bias.\n\n- **(a)** Positive voltage applied: Accumulation of electrons.\n- **(b)** Negative voltage applied: Induced positive space charge region.\n- **(c)** \"Large\" negative voltage: Inversion layer of holes.\n\nThe potential is the potential difference across the space charge layer. The space charge width can now be written in a form similar to that of a one-sided pn junction. We can write that\n\n\\[\nx_d = \\left( \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s \\phi_b}{e N_A} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(10.5)\n\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon_s\\) is the permittivity of the semiconductor. Equation (10.5) assumes that the abrupt depletion approximation is valid.\n\n**Figure 10.8** | The energy-band diagram in the p-type semiconductor, indicating surface potential.\n\nFigure 10.9 shows the energy bands for the case in which \\( \\phi_s = 2\\phi_p \\). The Fermi level at the surface is as far above the intrinsic level as the Fermi level is below the intrinsic level in the bulk semiconductor. The electron concentration at the surface is the same as the hole concentration in the bulk material. This condition is known as the **threshold inversion point**. The applied gate voltage creating this condition is known as the **threshold voltage**. If the gate voltage increases above this threshold value, the conduction band will bend slightly closer to the Fermi level, but the change in the conduction band at the surface is now only a slight function of gate voltage. The electron concentration at the surface, however, is an exponential function of the surface potential. The surface potential may increase by a few \\( (kT/e) \\) volts, which will change the electron concentration by orders of magnitude, but the space charge width changes only slightly. In this case, then, the space charge region has essentially reached a maximum width.\n\n**Figure 10.9** | The energy-band diagram in the p-type semiconductor at the threshold inversion point.\n\nThe maximum space charge width, \\( x_{\\text{scr}} \\), at this inversion transition point can be calculated from Equation (10.5) by setting \\(\\Phi_s = 2\\Phi_p\\). Then\n\n\\[\nx_{\\text{scr}} = \\left( \\frac{4 \\varepsilon_s \\Phi_p}{e N_a} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(10.6)\n\nWe have been considering a p-type semiconductor substrate. The same maximum induced space charge region width occurs in an n-type substrate. Figure 10.10 is the energy-band diagram at the threshold voltage with an n-type substrate. We can write\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_n = V_t \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_d}{n_i} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.7)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nx_{\\text{scr}} = \\left( \\frac{4 \\varepsilon_s \\Phi_n}{e N_d} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(10.8)\n\nNote that we are always assuming the parameters \\(\\Phi_s\\) and \\(\\Phi_n\\) to be positive quantities.\n\nFigure 10.11 is a plot of \\( x_{\\text{scr}} \\) at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) as a function of doping concentration in silicon. The semiconductor doping can be either n type or p type.\n\n**Figure 10.10** The energy-band diagram in the n-type semiconductor at the threshold inversion point.\n\n**Figure 10.11** Maximum induced space charge region width versus semiconductor doping.\n\n### 10.1.3 Surface Charge Density\n\nFrom the results of Chapter 4, the electron concentration in the conduction band can be written in the form\n\n\\[\nn = n_i \\exp \\left[ \\frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.9)\n\nFor a p-type semiconductor substrate, the electron inversion charge density can then be written as (see Figure 10.9)\n\n\\[\nn_s = n_i \\exp \\left[ \\frac{e(\\phi_s + \\Delta \\phi_s)}{kT} \\right] = n_i \\exp \\left[ \\frac{\\phi_s + \\Delta \\phi_s}{V_t} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.10a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nn_s = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\phi_s}{V_t}\\right) \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi_s}{V_t}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.10b)\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta \\phi_s\\) is the surface potential greater than \\(2\\phi_{fp}\\).\n\nWe may note that\n\n\\[\nn_{st} = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\phi_s}{V_t}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.11)\n\nwhere \\(n_{st}\\) is the surface charge density at the threshold inversion point. The electron inversion charge density can then be written as\n\n\\[\nn_s = n_{st} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi_s}{V_t}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.12)\n\nFigure 10.12 shows the electron inversion charge density as a function of surface potential for the case when the threshold inversion charge density is \\(n_{st} = 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\). We may note that the inversion charge density increases by a factor of 10 with a 60-mV increase in surface potential. As discussed previously, the electron inversion charge density increases rapidly with small increases in surface potential, which means that the space charge width essentially reaches a maximum value.\n\n**Figure 10.12** | Electron inversion charge density as a function of surface potential.\n\n| \\(\\phi_s\\) (volts) | \\(n_s\\) (cm\\(^{-3}\\)) |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| \\(2\\phi_{fp}\\)     | \\(10^{16}\\)           |\n| \\(2\\phi_{fp} + 0.06\\) | \\(10^{17}\\)       |\n| \\(2\\phi_{fp} + 0.12\\) | \\(10^{18}\\)       |\n\n\n### 10.1.4 Work Function Differences\n\nWe have been concerned, so far, with the energy-band diagrams of the semiconductor material. Figure 10.13a shows the energy levels in the metal, silicon dioxide (SiO₂), and silicon relative to the vacuum level. The metal work function is \\( \\phi_m \\), and the electron affinity is \\( \\chi \\). The parameter \\( \\chi_i \\) is the oxide electron affinity and, for SiO₂, \\( \\chi_i = 0.9 \\, \\text{V} \\).\n\nFigure 10.13b shows the energy-band diagram of the entire MOS structure with zero gate voltage applied. The Fermi level is a constant through the entire system at thermal equilibrium. We may define \\( \\phi_m' \\) as a modified metal work function—the potential required to inject an electron from the metal into the conduction band of the oxide. Similarly, \\( \\chi' \\) is defined as a modified electron affinity. The voltage \\( V_{ox0} \\) is the potential drop across the oxide for zero applied gate voltage and is not necessarily zero because of the difference between \\( \\phi_m \\) and \\( \\chi \\). The potential \\( \\phi_s \\) is the surface potential for this case.\n\nIf we sum the energies from the Fermi level on the metal side to the Fermi level on the semiconductor side, we have\n\n\\[\ne\\phi_m' + eV_{ox0} = e\\chi' + \\frac{E_t}{2e} - e\\phi_s + e\\phi_{Fi}\n\\]\n\n(10.13)\n\nEquation (10.13) can be rewritten as\n\n\\[\nV_{ox0} + \\phi_s = - \\left[ \\phi_m' - \\left( \\chi' + \\frac{E_t}{2e} + \\phi_{Fi} \\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.14)\n\n\n**Figure 10.13** (a) Energy levels in a MOS system prior to contact and (b) energy-band diagram through the MOS structure in thermal equilibrium after contact.\n\nWe can define a potential \\(\\phi_{ms}\\) as\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{ms} = \\left[ \\phi_m' - \\left( \\chi' + \\frac{E_g}{2e} + \\phi_b \\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.15)\n\nwhich is known as the metal–semiconductor work function difference.\n\nDegenerately doped polysilicon deposited on the oxide is also often used as the metal gate. Figure 10.14a shows the energy-band diagram of a MOS capacitor with an \\(n^+\\) polysilicon gate and a p-type substrate. Figure 10.14b shows the energy-band diagram.\n\n**Figure 10.14** | Energy-band diagram through the MOS structure with a p-type substrate at zero gate bias for (a) an \\(n^+\\) polysilicon gate and (b) a \\(p^+\\) polysilicon gate.\n\n\nDiagram for the case of a p⁺ polysilicon gate and the p-type silicon substrate. In the degenerately doped polysilicon, we will initially assume that \\( E_F = E_c \\) for the n⁺ case and \\( E_F = E_v \\) for the p⁺ case.\n\nFor the n⁺ polysilicon gate, the metal–semiconductor work function difference can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{ms} = \\left[ \\chi' - \\left( \\frac{E_t}{2e} + \\phi_p \\right) \\right] = - \\left( \\frac{E_t}{2e} + \\phi_p \\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.16)\n\nand for the p⁺ polysilicon gate, we have\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{ms} = \\left[ \\left( \\chi' + \\frac{E_t}{e} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{E_t}{2e} + \\phi_p \\right) \\right] = \\left( \\frac{E_t}{2e} - \\phi_p \\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.17)\n\nHowever, for degenerately doped n⁺ polysilicon and p⁺ polysilicon, the Fermi level can be above \\( E_c \\) and below \\( E_v \\), respectively, by 0.1 to 0.2 V. The experimental \\( \\phi_{ms} \\) values will then be slightly different from the values calculated by using Equations (10.16) and (10.17).\n\nWe have been considering a p-type semiconductor substrate. We may also have an n-type semiconductor substrate in a MOS capacitor. Figure 10.15 shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS capacitor with a metal gate and the n-type semiconductor substrate, for the case when a negative voltage is applied to the gate. The metal–semiconductor work function difference for this case is defined as\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{ms} = \\phi'_m - \\left( \\chi' + \\frac{E_t}{2e} - \\phi_n \\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.18)\n\n\n**Figure 10.15** Energy-band diagram through the MOS structure with an n-type substrate for a negative applied gate bias.\n\n**Figure 10.16** Metal–semiconductor work function difference versus doping for aluminum, gold, and n\\(^+\\) and p\\(^+\\) polysilicon gates.  \n*(From Sze [17] and Werner [20].)*\n\nwhere \\(\\phi_{ms}\\) is assumed to be a positive value. We will have similar expressions for n\\(^+\\) and p\\(^+\\) polysilicon gates.\n\nFigure 10.16 shows the work function differences as a function of semiconductor doping for the various types of gates. We may note that the magnitudes of \\(\\phi_{ms}\\) for the polysilicon gates are somewhat larger than Equations (10.16) and (10.17) predict. This difference again is because the Fermi level is not equal to the conduction-band energy for the n\\(^+\\) gate and is not equal to the valence-band energy for the p\\(^+\\) gate. The metal–semiconductor work function difference becomes important in the flat-band and threshold voltage parameters discussed next.\n\n### 10.1.5 Flat-Band Voltage\n\nThe **flat-band voltage** is defined as the applied gate voltage such that there is no band bending in the semiconductor and, as a result, zero net space charge in this region. Figure 10.17 shows this flat-band condition. Because of the work function difference and possible trapped charge in the oxide, the voltage across the oxide for this case is not necessarily zero.\n\nWe have implicitly been assuming that there is zero net charge density in the oxide material. This assumption may not be valid—a net fixed charge density,\n\n**Figure 10.17** | Energy-band diagram of a MOS capacitor at flat band.\n\nUsually positive, may exist in the insulator. The positive charge has been identified with broken or dangling covalent bonds near the oxide–semiconductor interface. During the thermal formation of SiO₂, oxygen diffuses through the oxide and reacts near the Si–SiO₂ interface to form the SiO₂. Silicon atoms may also break away from the silicon material just prior to reacting to form SiO₂. When the oxidation process is terminated, excess silicon may exist in the oxide near the interface, resulting in the dangling bonds. The magnitude of this oxide charge seems, in general, to be a strong function of the oxidizing conditions such as oxidizing ambient and temperature. The charge density can be altered to some degree by annealing the oxide in an argon or nitrogen atmosphere. However, the charge is rarely zero.\n\nThe net fixed charge in the oxide appears to be located fairly close to the oxide–semiconductor interface. We will assume in the analysis of the MOS structure that an equivalent trapped charge per unit area, \\( Q_{\\text{ox}}' \\), is located in the oxide directly adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface. For the moment, we will ignore any other oxide-type charges that may exist in the device. The parameter \\( Q_{\\text{ox}}' \\) is usually given in terms of number of electronic charges per unit area.\n\nEquation (10.14), for zero applied gate voltage, can be written as\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{ox0}} + \\phi_{\\text{ox}} = -\\phi_{\\text{ms}}\n\\]\n\n(10.19)\n\nIf a gate voltage is applied, the potential drop across the oxide and the surface potential will change. We can then write\n\n\\[\nV_G = \\Delta V_{\\text{ox}} + \\Delta \\phi_s = (V_{\\text{ox}} - V_{\\text{ox0}}) + (\\phi_s - \\phi_{\\text{ox}})\n\\]\n\n(10.20)\n\nUsing Equation (10.19), we have\n\n\\[\nV_G = V_{\\text{ox}} + \\phi_s + \\phi_{\\text{ms}}\n\\]\n\n(10.21)\n\nFigure 10.18 shows the charge distribution in the MOS structure for the flat-band condition. There is zero net charge in the semiconductor, and we can assume that an equivalent fixed surface charge density exists in the oxide. The charge density on the metal is \\( Q_m' \\), and from charge neutrality we have\n\n\\[\nQ_m' + Q_{\\text{ox}}' = 0\n\\]\n\n(10.22)\n\nWe can relate \\( Q_{\\text{ox}}' \\) to the voltage across the oxide by\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{ox}} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{ox}}'}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n\\]\n\n(10.23)\n\n\n**Figure 10.18** Charge distribution in a MOS capacitor at flat band.\n\nwhere \\( C_{\\text{ox}} \\) is the oxide capacitance per unit area. Substituting Equation (10.22) into Equation (10.23), we have\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{ox}} = -\\frac{Q'_{\\text{ox}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n\\]\n\n(10.24)\n\nIn the flat-band condition, the surface potential is zero, or \\( \\phi_s = 0 \\). Then from Equation (10.21), we have\n\n\\[\nV_G = V_{FB} = \\phi_{ms} - \\frac{Q'_{\\text{ox}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n\\]\n\n(10.25)\n\nEquation (10.25) is the flat-band voltage for this MOS device.\n\n### 10.1.6 Threshold Voltage\n\nThe threshold voltage is defined as the applied gate voltage required to achieve the threshold inversion point. The threshold inversion point, in turn, is defined as the condition when the surface potential is \\( \\phi_s = 2\\phi_f \\) for the p-type semiconductor and \\( \\phi_s = 2\\phi_{fb} \\) for the n-type semiconductor. These conditions are shown in Figures 10.9 and 10.10. The threshold voltage will be derived in terms of the electrical and geometrical properties of the MOS capacitor.\n\nFigure 10.19 shows the charge distribution through the MOS device at the threshold inversion point for a p-type semiconductor substrate. The space charge width has reached its maximum value. We will assume that there is an equivalent oxide charge \\( Q'_{ox} \\) and the positive charge on the metal gate at threshold is \\( Q'_{mT} \\). The prime on the charge terms indicates charge per unit area. Even though we are assuming that the surface has been inverted, we will neglect the inversion layer charge at this threshold inversion point. From conservation of charge, we can write\n\n\\[\nQ'_{mT} + Q'_{s} = |Q'_{SD}(max)|\n\\]\n\n(10.26)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n|Q'_{SD}(max)| = eN_a x_{aT}\n\\]\n\n(10.27)\n\n\n**Figure 10.19** | Charge distribution in a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate at the threshold inversion point.\n\n**Figure 10.20** | Energy-band diagram through the MOS structure with a positive applied gate bias.\n\nand is the magnitude of the maximum space charge density per unit area of the depletion region.\n\nThe energy-band diagram of the MOS system with an applied positive gate voltage is shown in Figure 10.20. As we mentioned, an applied gate voltage will change the voltage across the oxide and will change the surface potential. We had from Equation (10.20) that\n\n\\[\nV_G = \\Delta V_{ox} + \\Delta \\phi_s = V_{ox} + \\phi_s + \\phi_{ms}\n\\]\n\nAt threshold, we can define \\( V_G = V_{TN} \\), where \\( V_{TN} \\) is the threshold voltage that creates the electron inversion layer charge. The surface potential is \\( \\phi_s = 2\\phi_f \\) at threshold, so Equation (10.20) can be written as\n\n\\[\nV_{TN} = V_{oxT} + 2\\phi_f + \\phi_{ms} \\tag{10.28}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V_{oxT} \\) is the voltage across the oxide at this threshold inversion point.\n\nThe voltage \\( V_{oxT} \\) can be related to the charge on the metal and to the oxide capacitance by\n\n\\[\nV_{oxT} = \\frac{Q'_m}{C_{ox}} \\tag{10.29}\n\\]\n\nwhere again \\( C_{ox} \\) is the oxide capacitance per unit area. Using Equation (10.26), we can write\n\n\\[\nV_{oxT} = \\frac{Q'_m}{C_{ox}} = \\frac{1}{C_{ox}} \\left( |Q'_s(\\text{max})| - Q'_i \\right) \\tag{10.30}\n\\]\n\nFinally, the threshold voltage can be written as\n\n\\[\nV_{TN} = \\frac{|Q'_s(\\text{max})|}{C_{ox}} - \\frac{Q'_i}{C_{ox}} + \\phi_{ms} + 2\\phi_f \\tag{10.31a}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nV_{TN} = \\left( \\frac{|Q'_s(\\text{max})| - Q'_i}{t_{ox}/\\epsilon_{ox}} \\right) + \\phi_{ms} + 2\\phi_f \\tag{10.31b}\n\\]\n\n  \nUsing the definition of flat-band voltage from Equation (10.25), we can also express the threshold voltage as\n\n\\[\nV_{TN} = \\frac{|Q'_s(\\text{max})|}{C_{ox}} + V_{FB} + 2\\phi_f\n\\]\n\n(10.31c)\n\nFor a given semiconductor material, oxide material, and gate metal, the threshold voltage is a function of semiconductor doping, oxide charge \\(Q'_s\\), and oxide thickness.\n\nA negative threshold voltage for a p-type substrate implies a depletion mode device. A negative voltage must be applied to the gate in order to make the inversion.\n\n**Figure 10.21** Threshold voltage of an n-channel MOSFET versus the p-type substrate doping concentration for various values of oxide trapped charge (\\(t_{\\text{ox}} = 500 \\, \\text{Å}\\), aluminum gate).\n\nlayer charge equal to zero, whereas a positive gate voltage will induce a larger inversion layer charge.\n\nFigure 10.21 is a plot of the threshold voltage \\(V_{TN}\\) as a function of the acceptor doping concentration for various positive oxide charge values. We may note that the p-type semiconductor must be somewhat heavily doped in order to obtain an enhancement mode device.\n\nThe previous derivation of the threshold voltage assumed a p-type semiconductor for substrate. The same type of derivation can be done with an n-type semiconductor substrate, where a negative gate voltage can induce an inversion layer of holes at the oxide–semiconductor interface.\n\nFigure 10.15 shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS structure with an n-type substrate and with an applied negative gate voltage. The threshold voltage for this case can be derived and is given by\n\n\\[\nV_{TP} = \\left(-|Q_{SD}(\\text{max})| - Q'_{it}\\right) \\left(\\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}}\\right) + \\phi_{ms} - 2\\phi_{f}\n\\]\n\n(10.32)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{ms} = \\phi_m - \\left(\\chi' + \\frac{E_g}{2e} - \\phi_f\\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.33a)\n\n\\[\n|Q_{SD}(\\text{max})| = eN_Ax_{dT}\n\\]\n\n(10.33b)\n\n\\[\nx_{dT} = \\left(\\frac{4\\epsilon_s\\phi_f}{eN_A}\\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(10.33c)\n\n**Figure 10.22** | Threshold voltage of a p-channel MOSFET versus the n-type substrate doping concentration for various values of oxide trapped charge (\\(t_{\\text{ox}} = 500 \\, \\text{Å}\\), aluminum gate).\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\phi_n = V_T \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_d}{n_i} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.33d)\n\nWe may note that \\(x_{\\text{ox}}\\) and \\(\\phi_n\\) are defined as positive quantities. We may also note that the notation of \\(V_{TP}\\) is the threshold voltage that will induce an inversion layer of holes.

We may note that, for all values of positive oxide charge, this MOS capacitor is always an enhancement mode device.

    "text": "## 10.2 CAPACITANCE–VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nAs mentioned previously, the MOS capacitor structure is the heart of the MOSFET. A great deal of information about the MOS device and the oxide–semiconductor interface can be obtained from the capacitance versus voltage or C–V characteristics of the device. The capacitance of a device is defined as\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{dQ}{dV}\n\\]\n\n(10.34)\n\nwhere \\( dQ \\) is the magnitude of the differential change in charge on one plate as a function of the differential change in voltage \\( dV \\) across the capacitor. The capacitance is a small-signal or ac parameter and is measured by superimposing a small ac voltage on an applied dc gate voltage. The capacitance, then, is measured as a function of the applied dc gate voltage.\n\n### 10.2.1 Ideal C–V Characteristics\n\nFirst we will consider the ideal C–V characteristics of the MOS capacitor and then discuss some of the deviations that occur from these idealized results. We will initially assume that there is zero charge trapped in the oxide and also that there is no charge trapped at the oxide–semiconductor interface.\n\nThere are three operating conditions of interest in the MOS capacitor: accumulation, depletion, and inversion. Figure 10.23a shows the energy-band diagram of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for the case when a negative voltage is applied to the gate, inducing an accumulation layer of holes in the semiconductor at the oxide–semiconductor interface. A small differential change in voltage across the MOS structure will cause a differential change in charge on the metal gate and also in the hole accumulation charge, as shown in Figure 10.23b. The differential changes in charge density occur at the edges of the oxide, as in a parallel-plate capacitor. The\n\n**Figure 10.23** (a) Energy-band diagram through a MOS capacitor for the accumulation mode. (b) Differential charge distribution at accumulation for a differential change in gate voltage.\n\n**Figure 10.24** (a) Energy-band diagram through a MOS capacitor for the depletion mode. (b) Differential charge distribution at depletion for a differential change in gate voltage.\n\nThe capacitance \\( C' \\) per unit area of the MOS capacitor for this accumulation mode is just the oxide capacitance, or\n\n\\[\nC'(acc) = C_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}\n\\]\n\n(10.35)\n\nFigure 10.24a shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS device when a small positive voltage is applied to the gate, inducing a space charge region in the semiconductor; Figure 10.24b shows the charge distribution through the device for this condition. The oxide capacitance and the capacitance of the depletion region are in series. A small differential change in voltage across the capacitor will cause a differential change in the space charge width. The corresponding differential changes in charge densities are shown in the figure. The total capacitance of the series combination is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C'(depl)} = \\frac{1}{C_{ox}} + \\frac{1}{C_{SD}}\n\\]\n(10.36a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nC'(depl) = \\frac{C_{ox} C_{SD}}{C_{ox} + C_{SD}}\n\\]\n(10.36b)\n\nSince \\( C_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} \\) and \\( C_{SD} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{s}}{x_d} \\), Equation (10.36b) can be written as\n\n\\[\nC'(depl) = \\frac{C_{ox}}{1 + \\frac{C_{ox}}{C_{SD}}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox} + \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} \\right) x_d}\n\\]\n(10.37)\n\nAs the space charge width increases, the total capacitance \\( C'(depl) \\) decreases.\n\nWe had defined the threshold inversion point to be the condition when the maximum depletion width is reached, but there is essentially zero inversion charge density. This condition will yield a minimum capacitance \\( C'_{min} \\), which is given by\n\n\\[\nC'_{min} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox} + \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} \\right) x_{dT}}\n\\]\n(10.38)\n\nFigure 10.25a shows the energy-band diagram of this MOS device for the inversion condition. In the ideal case, a small incremental change in the voltage across the MOS capacitor will cause a differential change in the inversion layer charge density. The space charge width does not change. If the inversion charge can respond to the change in capacitor voltage as indicated in Figure 10.25b, then the capacitance is again just the oxide capacitance, or\n\n\\[\nC'(inv) = C_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}\n\\]\n(10.39)\n\n\n**Figure 10.25** | (a) Energy-band diagram through a MOS capacitor for the inversion mode. (b) Differential charge distribution at inversion for a low-frequency differential change in gate voltage.\n\n\n**Figure 10.26** | Ideal low-frequency capacitance versus gate voltage of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate. Individual capacitance components are also shown.\n\nFigure 10.26 shows the ideal capacitance versus gate voltage, or C–V, characteristics of the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate. The three dashed segments correspond to the three components \\( C_{ox}, C_{SD}, \\) and \\( C'_{inv} \\). The solid curve is the ideal net capacitance of the MOS capacitor. Moderate inversion, which is indicated in the figure, is the transition region between the point when only the space charge density changes with gate voltage and when only the inversion charge density changes with gate voltage.\n\nThe point on the curve that corresponds to the flat-band condition is of interest. The flat-band condition occurs between the accumulation and depletion conditions. The capacitance at flat band is given by\n\n\\[\nC_{FB} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} + \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{\\varepsilon_s} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{kT}{q} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_s}{qN_a} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(10.40)\n\nWe may note that the flat-band capacitance is a function of oxide thickness as well as semiconductor doping. The general location of this point on the C–V plot is shown in Figure 10.26.\n\nIf we assume the oxide capacitance per unit area is \\( C_{ox} = 1.9175 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/cm}^2 \\) and the channel length and width are \\( L = 2 \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\) and \\( W = 20 \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\), respectively, then the total gate oxide capacitance is\n\n\\[\nC_{oxT} = C_{ox} \\cdot L \\cdot W = (1.9175 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-4})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 7.67 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ F} = 0.0767 \\text{ pF} = 76.7 \\text{ fF}\n\\]\n\nThe total oxide capacitance in a typical MOS device is quite small.\n\n**Figure 10.27** Ideal low-frequency capacitance versus gate voltage of a MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate.\n\nThe same type of ideal C–V characteristics is obtained for a MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate by changing the sign of the voltage axis. The accumulation condition is obtained for a positive gate bias and the inversion condition is obtained for a negative gate bias. This ideal curve is shown in Figure 10.27.\n\n### 10.2.2 Frequency Effects\n\nFigure 10.25a shows the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate and biased in the inversion condition. We have argued that a differential change in the capacitor voltage in the ideal case causes a differential change in the inversion layer charge density. However, we must consider the source of electrons that produces a change in the inversion charge density.\n\nThere are two sources of electrons that can change the charge density of the inversion layer. The first source is by diffusion of minority carrier electrons from the p-type substrate across the space charge region. This diffusion process is the same as that in a reverse-biased pn junction that generates the ideal reverse saturation current. The second source of electrons is by thermal generation of electron–hole pairs within the space charge region. This process is again the same as that in a reverse-biased pn junction generating the reverse-biased generation current. Both of these processes generate electrons at a particular rate. The electron concentration in the inversion layer, then, cannot change instantaneously. If the ac voltage across the MOS capacitor changes rapidly, the change in the inversion layer charge will not be able to respond. The C–V characteristics will then be a function of the frequency of the ac signal used to measure the capacitance.\n\nIn the limit of a very high frequency, the inversion layer charge will not respond to a differential change in capacitor voltage. Figure 10.28 shows the charge distribution in the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate. At a high-signal frequency, the differential change in charge occurs at the metal and in the space charge width in the semiconductor.\n\nThe capacitance of the MOS capacitor is then \\( C_{\\text{min}} \\), which we discussed earlier. Both the high-frequency and low-frequency limits of the C–V characteristics are shown in Figure 10.29. In general, high frequency corresponds to a value on the order of 1 MHz and low frequency corresponds to values in the range of 5 to 100 Hz. Typically, the high-frequency characteristics of the MOS capacitor are measured.\n\n**Figure 10.28** | Differential charge distribution at inversion for a high-frequency differential change in gate voltage.\n\n**Figure 10.29** | Low-frequency and high-frequency capacitance versus gate voltage of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate.\n\n### 10.2.3 Fixed Oxide and Interface Charge Effects\n\nIn all of the discussion concerning C–V characteristics so far, we have assumed an ideal oxide in which there are no fixed oxide or oxide–semiconductor interface charges. These two types of charges will change the C–V characteristics.\n\nWe previously discussed how the fixed oxide charge affects the threshold voltage. This charge will also affect the flat-band voltage. The flat-band voltage from Equation (10.25) is given by\n\n\\[\nV_{FB} = \\phi_{ms} - \\frac{Q'_f}{C_{ox}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Q'_f \\) is the equivalent fixed oxide charge and \\( \\phi_{ms} \\) is the metal–semiconductor work function difference. The flat-band voltage shifts to more negative voltages for a positive fixed oxide charge. Since the oxide charge is not a function of gate voltage, the curves show a parallel shift with oxide charge, and the shape of the C–V curves remains the same as the ideal characteristics. Figure 10.30 shows the high-frequency characteristics of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for several values of fi xed positive oxide charge.\n\n**Figure 10.30** | High-frequency capacitance versus gate voltage of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for several values of effective trapped oxide charge.\n\n- \\( Q_{ox} > Q'_{ox} > Q''_{ox} > Q'''_{ox} > 0 \\)\n- \\( Q'_{ox} = 0 \\) (ideal)\n\n**Figure 10.31** | Schematic diagram showing interface states at the oxide–semiconductor interface.\n\n- Allowed electronic energy states\n- Acceptor states\n- Donor states\n\n\nThe C–V characteristics can be used to determine the equivalent fixed oxide charge. For a given MOS structure, \\(\\phi_{ms}\\) and \\(C_{ox}\\) are known, so the ideal flat-band voltage and flat-band capacitance can be calculated. The experimental value of flat-band voltage can be measured from the C–V curve, and the value of fixed oxide charge can then be determined. The C–V measurements are a valuable diagnostic tool to characterize a MOS device. This characterization is especially useful in the study of radiation effects on MOS devices, for example.\n\nWe first encountered oxide–semiconductor interface states in Chapter 9 in the discussion of Schottky barrier diodes. Figure 10.31 shows the energy-band diagram of a semiconductor at the oxide–semiconductor interface. The periodic nature of the semiconductor is abruptly terminated at the interface so that allowed electronic energy levels will exist within the forbidden bandgap. These allowed energy states are referred to as interface states. Charge can flow between the semiconductor and interface states, in contrast to the fixed oxide charge. The net charge in these interface states is a function of the position of the Fermi level in the bandgap.\n\nIn general, acceptor states exist in the upper half of the bandgap and donor states exist in the lower half of the bandgap. An acceptor state is neutral if the Fermi level is below the state and becomes negatively charged if the Fermi level is above the state. A donor state is neutral if the Fermi level is above the state and becomes positively charged if the Fermi level is below the state. The charge of the interface states is then a function of the gate voltage applied across the MOS capacitor.\n\nFigure 10.32a shows the energy-band diagram in a p-type semiconductor of a MOS capacitor biased in the accumulation condition. In this case, there is a net positive charge trapped in the donor states. Now let the gate voltage change to produce the energy-band diagram shown in Figure 10.32b. The Fermi level corresponds to the intrinsic Fermi level at the surface; thus, all interface states are neutral. This particular bias condition is known as **midgap**. Figure 10.32c shows the condition at inversion in which there is now a net negative charge in the acceptor states.\n\n**Figure 10.32** | Energy-band diagram in a p-type semiconductor showing the charge trapped in the interface states when the MOS capacitor is biased (a) in accumulation, (b) at midgap, and (c) at inversion.\n\nThe net charge in the interface states changes from positive to negative as the gate voltage sweeps from the accumulation, depletion, to the inversion condition. We noted that the C–V curves shifted in the negative gate voltage direction due to positive fixed oxide charge. When interface states are present, the amount and direction of the shift change as we sweep through the gate voltage, since the amount and sign of the interface trapped charge change. The C–V curves now become “smeared out” as shown in Figure 10.33.\n\nAgain, the C–V measurements can be used as a diagnostic tool in semiconductor device process control. For a given MOS device, the ideal C–V curve can be determined.\n\n**Figure 10.33** | High-frequency C–V characteristics of a MOS capacitor showing effects of interface states.\n\nAny “smearing out” in the experimental curve indicates the presence of interface states and any parallel shift indicates the presence of fixed oxide charge. The amount of smearing out can be used to determine the density of interface states. These types of measurement are extremely useful in the study of radiation effects on MOS devices.",

    "text": "## 10.3 The Basic MOSFET Operation\n\nThe current in a MOSFET is due to the flow of charge in the inversion layer or channel region adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface. We have discussed the creation of the inversion layer charge in enhancement-type MOS capacitors. We may also have depletion-type devices in which a channel already exists at zero gate voltage.\n\n### 10.3.1 MOSFET Structures\n\nThere are four basic MOSFET device types. Figure 10.34 shows an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET. Implicit in the enhancement mode notation is the idea that the semiconductor substrate is not inverted directly under the oxide with zero gate voltage. A positive gate voltage induces the electron inversion layer, which then “connects” the n-type source and the n-type drain regions. The source terminal is the source of carriers that flow through the channel to the drain terminal. For this n-channel device, electrons flow from the source to the drain so the conventional current will enter the drain and leave the source. The conventional circuit symbol for this n-channel enhancement mode device is also shown in the figure.\n\nFigure 10.35 shows an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET. An n-channel region exists under the oxide with 0 V applied to the gate. However, we have shown that the threshold voltage of a MOS device with a p-type substrate may be negative; this means that an electron inversion layer already exists with zero gate voltage applied. Such a device is also considered to be a depletion mode device. The n-channel shown in the figure can be an electron inversion layer or an intentionally doped n region. The conventional circuit symbol for the n-channel depletion mode MOSFET is also shown in the figure.\n\nFigures 10.36a, b show a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and a p-channel depletion mode MOSFET. In the p-channel enhancement mode device, a negative gate voltage...\n\n**Figure 10.34** | Cross section and circuit symbol for an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET.\n\n- **Source (S)**\n- **Gate (G)**\n- **Drain (D)**\n- **Substrate or body (B)**\n\n**Figure 10.35** | Cross section and circuit symbol for an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET.\n\n- **Source (S)**\n- **Gate (G)**\n- **Drain (D)**\n- **Body (B)**\n\nGate voltage must be applied to create an inversion layer of holes that will “connect” the p-type source and drain regions. Holes flow from the source to the drain, so the conventional current will enter the source and leave the drain. A p-channel region exists in the depletion mode device even with zero gate voltage. The conventional circuit symbols are shown in the figure.\n\n### 10.3.2 Current–Voltage Relationship—Concepts\n\nFigure 10.37a shows an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET with a gate-to-source voltage that is less than the threshold voltage and with only a very small drain-to-source voltage. The source and substrate, or body, terminals are held at ground potential. With this bias configuration, there is no electron inversion layer, the drain-to-substrate pn junction is reverse biased, and the drain current is zero (disregarding pn junction leakage currents).\n\n**Figure 10.36** | Cross section and circuit symbol for (a) a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and (b) a p-channel depletion mode MOSFET.\n\nFigure 10.37b shows the same MOSFET with an applied gate voltage such that \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\). An electron inversion layer has been created so that when a small drain voltage is applied, the electrons in the inversion layer will flow from the source to the positive drain terminal. The conventional current enters the drain terminal and leaves the source terminal. In this ideal case, there is no current through the oxide to the gate terminal.\n\nFor small \\( V_{DS} \\) values, the channel region has the characteristics of a resistor, so we can write\n\n\\[\nI_D = g_d V_{DS}\n\\]\n\n(10.41)\n\nwhere \\( g_d \\) is defined as the channel conductance in the limit as \\( V_{DS} \\to 0 \\). The channel conductance is given by\n\n\\[\ng_d = \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot \\mu_n |Q_I'|\n\\]\n\n(10.42)\n\n**Figure 10.37** | The n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET (a) with an applied gate voltage \\( V_{GS} < V_T \\) and (b) with an applied gate voltage \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\).\n\n**Figure 10.38** | \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) characteristics for small values of \\( V_{DS} \\) at three \\( V_{GS} \\) voltages.\n\n\nwhere \\( \\mu_n \\) is the mobility of the electrons in the inversion layer and \\(|Q_I|\\) is the magnitude of the inversion layer charge per unit area. The inversion layer charge is a function of the gate voltage; thus, the basic MOS transistor action is the modulation of the channel conductance by the gate voltage. The channel conductance, in turn, determines the drain current. We will initially assume that the mobility is a constant; we will discuss mobility effects and variations in the next chapter.\n\nThe \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) characteristics, for small values of \\( V_{DS} \\), are shown in Figure 10.38. When \\( V_{GS} < V_T \\), the drain current is zero. As \\( V_{GS} \\) becomes larger than \\( V_T \\), channel inversion charge density increases, which increases the channel conductance. A larger value of \\( g_d \\) produces a larger initial slope of the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) characteristic as shown in the figure.\n\nFigure 10.39a shows the basic MOS structure for the case when \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\) and the applied \\( V_{DS} \\) voltage is small. The thickness of the inversion channel layer in the\n\n**Figure 10.39** Cross section and \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve when \\( V_{GS} < V_T \\) for (a) a small \\( V_{DS} \\) value, (b) a larger \\( V_{DS} \\) value, (c) a value of \\( V_{DS} = V_{DS(sat)} \\), and (d) a value of \\( V_{DS} > V_{DS(sat)} \\).\n\n- **(a)**: \\( V_{GS1} > V_T \\)\n  - **Diagram**: Shows channel inversion charge and depletion region.\n  - **Graph**: Linear increase of \\( I_D \\) with \\( V_{DS} \\).\n\n- **(b)**: \n  - **Diagram**: Increased channel inversion charge.\n  - **Graph**: Continued increase of \\( I_D \\) with \\( V_{DS} \\).\n\n- **(c)**: \n  - **Diagram**: \\( V_{DS} = V_{DS(sat)} \\)\n  - **Graph**: \\( I_D \\) reaches saturation at \\( V_{DS(sat)} \\).\n\n- **(d)**: \n  - **Diagram**: \\( V_{DS} > V_{DS(sat)} \\), E-field present.\n  - **Graph**: \\( I_D \\) in saturation region beyond \\( V_{DS(sat)} \\).\n\nThe figure qualitatively indicates the relative charge density, which is essentially constant along the entire channel length for this case. The corresponding \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve is shown in the figure.\n\nFigure 10.39b shows the situation when the \\( V_{DS} \\) value increases. As the drain voltage increases, the voltage drop across the oxide near the drain terminal decreases, which means that the induced inversion charge density near the drain also decreases. The incremental conductance of the channel at the drain decreases, which then means that the slope of the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve will decrease. This effect is shown in the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve in the figure.\n\nWhen \\( V_{DS} \\) increases to the point where the potential drop across the oxide at the drain terminal is equal to \\( V_T \\), the induced inversion charge density is zero at the drain terminal. This effect is schematically shown in Figure 10.39c. At this point, the incremental conductance at the drain is zero, which means that the slope of the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve is zero. We can write\n\n\\[\nV_{GS} - V_{DS(sat)} = V_T \\tag{10.43a}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nV_{DS(sat)} = V_{GS} - V_T \\tag{10.43b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V_{DS(sat)} \\) is the drain-to-source voltage producing zero inversion charge density at the drain terminal.\n\nWhen \\( V_{DS} \\) becomes larger than the \\( V_{DS(sat)} \\) value, the point in the channel at which the inversion charge is just zero moves toward the source terminal. In this case, electrons enter the channel at the source, travel through the channel toward the drain, and then, at the point where the charge goes to zero, the electrons are injected into the space charge region where they are swept by the E-field to the drain contact. If we assume that the change in channel length \\( \\Delta L \\) is small compared to the original length \\( L \\), then the drain current will be a constant for \\( V_{DS} > V_{DS(sat)} \\). The region of the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) characteristic is referred to as the saturation region. Figure 10.39d shows this region of operation.\n\nWhen \\( V_{GS} \\) changes, the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve will change. We saw that, if \\( V_{GS} \\) increases, the initial slope of \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) increases. We can also note from Equation (10.43b) that the value of \\( V_{DS(sat)} \\) is a function of \\( V_{GS} \\). We can generate the family of curves for this n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET as shown in Figure 10.40.\n\nFigure 10.41 shows an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET. If the n-channel region is actually an induced electron inversion layer created by the metal–semiconductor work function difference and fixed charge in the oxide, the current–voltage characteristics are exactly the same as we have discussed, except that \\( V_T \\) is a negative quantity. We may also consider the case when the n-channel region is actually an n-type semiconductor region. In this type of device, a negative gate voltage will induce a space charge region under the oxide, reducing the thickness of the n-channel region. The reduced thickness decreases the channel conductance, which reduces the drain current. A positive gate voltage will create an electron accumulation layer, which increases the drain current. One basic requirement for this device is that the channel\n\n**Figure 10.40** Family of \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curves for an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET.\n\n**Figure 10.41** Cross section of an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET.\n\nThickness \\( t_c \\) must be less than the maximum induced space charge width in order to be able to turn the device off. The general \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) family of curves for an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET is shown in Figure 10.42.\n\nIn the next section, we derive the ideal current–voltage relation for the n-channel MOSFET. In the nonsaturation region, we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L} \\left[ 2(V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.44a)\n\nwhich can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{k'}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ 2(V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.44b)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nI_D = K_n \\left[ 2(V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.44c)\n\n**Figure 10.42** Family of \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curves for an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET.\n\nThe parameter \\( k' = \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\) is called the **process conduction parameter** for the n-channel MOSFET and has units of A/V\\(^2\\). The parameter \\( K_n = (W/L) \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}}/2L = (k'/2) \\cdot (W/L) \\) is called the **conduction parameter** for the n-channel MOSFET and also has units of A/V\\(^2\\).\n\nWhen the transistor is biased in the saturation region, the ideal current–voltage relation is given by\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}}}{2L} (V_{\\text{GS}} - V_T)^2 \\tag{10.45a}\n\\]\n\nwhich can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{k'}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot (V_{\\text{GS}} - V_T)^2 \\tag{10.45b}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nI_D = K_n (V_{\\text{GS}} - V_T)^2 \\tag{10.45c}\n\\]\n\nIn general, for a given technology, the process conduction parameter, \\( k' \\), is a constant. From Equations (10.44b) and (10.45b), then, we see that the design of a MOSFET, in terms of current capability, is determined by the width-to-length parameter.\n\nThe operation of a p-channel device is the same as that of the n-channel device, except the charge carrier is the hole and the conventional current direction and voltage polarities are reversed.\n\n### *10.3.3 Current–Voltage Relationship—Mathematical Derivation\n\nIn the previous section, we qualitatively discussed the current–voltage characteristics. In this section, we derive the mathematical relation between the drain current, the gate-to-source voltage, and the drain-to-source voltage. Figure 10.43 shows the geometry of the device that we use in this derivation.\n\nIn this analysis, we make the following assumptions:\n\n1. The current in the channel is due to drift rather than diffusion.\n2. There is no current through the gate oxide.\n3. A gradual channel approximation is used in which \\(\\partial E_y/\\partial y \\gg \\partial E_x/\\partial x\\). This approximation means that \\(E_x\\) is essentially a constant.\n4. Any fixed oxide charge is an equivalent charge density at the oxide–semiconductor interface.\n5. The carrier mobility in the channel is constant.\n\nWe start the analysis with Ohm’s law, which can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_x = \\sigma E_x \\tag{10.46}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma\\) is the channel conductivity and \\(E_x\\) is the electric field along the channel created by the drain-to-source voltage. The channel conductivity is given by \\(\\sigma = e \\mu_n n(y)\\), where \\(\\mu_n\\) is the electron mobility and \\(n(y)\\) is the electron concentration in the inversion layer.\n\n**Figure 10.43** | Geometry of a MOSFET for \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) derivation.\n\nThe total channel current is found by integrating \\( J_x \\) over the cross-sectional area in the \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) directions. Then\n\n\\[\nI_s = \\int \\int J_x \\, dy \\, dz\n\\]\n\n(10.47)\n\nWe may write that\n\n\\[\nQ'_i = - \\int en(y) \\, dy\n\\]\n\n(10.48)\n\nwhere \\( Q'_i \\) is the inversion layer charge per unit area and is a negative quantity for this case.\n\nEquation (10.47) then becomes\n\n\\[\nI_s = -W \\mu_n Q'_i E_x\n\\]\n\n(10.49)\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the channel width, the result of integrating over \\( z \\).\n\nTwo concepts we use in the current–voltage derivation are charge neutrality and Gauss’s law. Figure 10.44 shows the charge densities through the device for \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\). The charges are all given in terms of charge per unit area. Using the concept of charge neutrality, we can write\n\n\\[\nQ'_i + Q'_d + Q'_s + Q_{DS}(max) = 0\n\\]\n\n(10.50)\n\nThe inversion layer charge and induced space charge are negative for this n-channel device.\n\nGauss’s law can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\oint \\varepsilon E_N \\, dS = Q_f\n\\]\n\n(10.51)\n\n**Figure 10.44** Charge distribution in the n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET for \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\).\n\n**Figure 10.45** Geometry for applying Gauss’s law.\n\nwhere the integral is over a closed surface. \\( Q_T \\) is the total charge enclosed by the surface, and \\( E_n \\) is the outward directed normal component of the electric field crossing the surface \\( S \\). Gauss’s law is applied to the surface defined in Figure 10.45. Since the surface must be enclosed, we must take into account the two end surfaces in the x-y plane. However, there is no z-component of the electric field so these two end surfaces do not contribute to the integral of Equation (10.51).\n\nNow consider the surfaces labeled 1 and 2 in Figure 10.45. From the gradual channel approximation, we assume that \\( E_n \\) is essentially a constant along the channel length. This assumption means that \\( E_n \\) into surface 2 is the same as \\( E_n \\) out of surface 1. Since the integral in Equation (10.51) involves the outward component of the E-field, the contributions of surfaces 1 and 2 cancel each other. Surface 3 is in the neutral p region, so the electric field is zero at this surface.\n\nSurface 4 is the only surface that contributes to Equation (10.51). Taking into account the direction of the electric field in the oxide, Equation (10.51) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\int_S \\varepsilon_n E_n \\, dS = -\\varepsilon_{ox} E_{ox} W \\, dx = Q_T \\tag{10.52}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\varepsilon_{ox} \\) is the permittivity of the oxide. The total charge enclosed is\n\n\\[\nQ_T = [Q'_i + Q'_d + Q'_{Si(\\text{max})}] W \\, dx \\tag{10.53}\n\\]\n\nCombining Equations (10.52) and (10.53), we have\n\n\\[\n-\\varepsilon_{ox} E_{ox} = Q'_i + Q'_d + Q'_{Si(\\text{max})} \\tag{10.54}\n\\]\n\nWe now need an expression for \\( E_{ox} \\). Figure 10.46a shows the oxide and channel. We assume that the source is at ground potential. The voltage \\( V_x \\) is the potential in the channel at a point \\( x \\) along the channel length. The potential difference across the oxide at \\( x \\) is a function of \\( V_{GS}, V_x \\), and the metal–semiconductor work function difference.\n\n**Figure 10.46:** (a) Potentials at a point \\( x \\) along the channel. (b) Energy-band diagram through the MOS structure at the point \\( x \\).\n\nThe energy-band diagram through the MOS structure at point \\( x \\) is shown in Figure 10.46b. The Fermi level in the p-type semiconductor is \\( E_{Fp} \\) and the Fermi level in the metal is \\( E_{Fm} \\). We have\n\n\\[\nE_{Fp} - E_{Fm} = e(V_{GS} - V_x)\n\\]\n\n(10.55)\n\nConsidering the potential barriers, we can write\n\n\\[\nV_{GS} - V_x = (\\phi_{b'} + V_{ox}) - \\left( x' + \\frac{E_c}{2e} - \\phi_b + \\phi_p \\right)\n\\]\n\n(10.56)\n\nwhich can also be written as\n\n\\[\nV_{GS} - V_x = V_{ox} + 2\\phi_b + \\phi_{ms}\n\\]\n\n(10.57)\n\nwhere \\( \\phi_{ms} \\) is the metal–semiconductor work function difference, and \\( \\phi_b = 2\\phi_p \\) for the inversion condition.\n\nThe electric field in the oxide is\n\n\\[\nE_{ox} = \\frac{V_{ox}}{t_{ox}}\n\\]\n\n(10.58)\n\nCombining Equations (10.54), (10.57), and (10.58), we find that\n\n\\[\n-\\epsilon_{ox} E_{ox} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} [(V_{GS} - V_x) - (\\phi_{ms} + 2\\phi_b)]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= Q_i' + Q_i'' + Q_{D_s}(\\text{max})\n\\]\n\n(10.59)\n\nThe inversion charge density, \\( Q_i'' \\), from Equation (10.59) can be substituted into Equation (10.49) and we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_x = -W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{dV_x}{dx} [(V_{GS} - V_T) - V_x]\n\\]\n\n(10.60)\n\nwhere \\( E_x = -dV_x/dx \\) and \\( V_T \\) is the threshold voltage defined by Equation (10.31b).\n\nWe can now integrate Equation (10.60) over the length of the channel. We have\n\n\\[\n\\int_0{L} I_x \\, dx = -W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\int_{V_{GS}}^{V_{(L)}} [(V_{GS} - V_T) - V_x] \\, dV_x\n\\]\n\n(10.61)\n\nWe are assuming a constant mobility \\( \\mu_n \\). For the n-channel device, the drain current enters the drain terminal and is a constant along the entire channel length. Letting \\( I_D = -I_n \\), Equation (10.61) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L} \\left[ 2(V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2 \\right] \\tag{10.62}\n\\]\n\nEquation (10.62) is valid for \\( V_{GS} \\geq V_T \\) and for \\( 0 \\leq V_{DS} \\leq V_{DS}(sat) \\).\n\nEquation (10.62) can also be written as\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{k_i}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ 2(V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2 \\right] = K_n [2(V_{GS} - V_T) V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2] \\tag{10.63}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k_i \\) is the process conduction parameter and \\( K_n \\) is the conduction parameter. These parameters are described and defined in Equations (10.44b) and (10.44c).\n\nFigure 10.47 shows plots of Equation (10.62) as a function of \\( V_{DS} \\) for several values of \\( V_{GS} \\). We can find the value of \\( V_{DS} \\) at the peak current value from \\( \\partial I_D / \\partial V_{DS} = 0 \\). Then, using Equation (10.62), the peak current occurs when\n\n\\[\nV_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_T \\tag{10.64}\n\\]\n\nThis value of \\( V_{DS} \\) is just \\( V_{DS}(sat) \\), the point at which saturation occurs. For \\( V_{DS} > V_{DS}(sat) \\), the ideal drain current is a constant and is equal to\n\n\\[\nI_D(sat) = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L} \\left[ 2(V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS}(sat) - V_{DS}(sat)^2 \\right] \\tag{10.65}\n\\]\n\nUsing Equation (10.64) for \\( V_{DS}(sat) \\), Equation (10.65) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_D(sat) = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\tag{10.66}\n\\]\n\nEquation (10.66) can also be written as\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{k_i}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 = K_n (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\tag{10.67}\n\\]\n\n**Figure 10.47** | Plots of \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) from Equation (10.62).\n\nEquation (10.62) is the ideal current–voltage relationship of the n-channel MOSFET in the nonsaturation region for \\(0 \\leq V_{DS} \\leq V_{DS(sat)}\\), and Equation (10.66) is the ideal current–voltage relationship of the n-channel MOSFET in the saturation region for \\(V_{DS} \\geq V_{DS(sat)}\\). These I–V expressions were explicitly derived for an n-channel enhancement mode device. However, these same equations apply to an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET in which the threshold voltage \\(V_T\\) is a negative quantity.\n\nWe can use the I–V relations to experimentally determine the mobility and threshold voltage parameters. From Equation (10.62), we can write, for very small values of \\(V_{DS}\\),\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{L} (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} \\tag{10.68}\n\\]\n\nFigure 10.48a shows a plot of Equation (10.68) as a function of \\(V_{GS}\\) for constant \\(V_{DS}\\). A straight line is fitted through the points. The deviation from the straight line at low values of \\(V_{GS}\\) is due to subthreshold conduction and the deviation at higher values of \\(V_{GS}\\) is due to mobility being a function of gate voltage. Both of these effects will be considered in the next chapter. The extrapolation of the straight line to zero current gives the threshold voltage, and the slope is proportional to the inversion carrier mobility.\n\n**Figure 10.48** (a) \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{GS} \\) (for small \\( V_{DS} \\)) for enhancement mode MOSFET.  \n(b) Ideal \\( \\sqrt{I_D} \\) versus \\( V_{GS} \\) in saturation region for enhancement mode (curve A) and depletion mode (curve B) n-channel MOSFETs.\n\nNow consider the case when the transistor is biased in the saturation region. If we take the square root of Equation (10.66), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{I_{D(sat)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L} (V_{GS} - V_T)}\n\\]\n\n(10.69)\n\nFigure 10.48b is a plot of Equation (10.69). In the ideal case, we can obtain the same information from both curves. However, as we will see in the next chapter, the threshold voltage may be a function of \\( V_{DS} \\) in short-channel devices. Since Equation (10.69) applies to devices biased in the saturation region, the \\( V_T \\) parameter in this equation may differ from the extrapolated value determined in Figure 10.48a. In general, the nonsaturation current–voltage characteristics will produce the more reliable data.\n\nThe current–voltage relationship of a p-channel device can be obtained by the same type of analysis. Figure 10.49 shows a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET. The voltage polarities and current direction are the reverse of those in the n-channel device. We may note the change in the subscript notation for this device. For the current direction shown in the figure, the \\( I–V \\) relation for the p-channel MOSFET biased in the nonsaturation region is\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{W \\mu_p C_{ox}}{2L} \\left[ 2(V_{SG} + V_T)V_{SD} - V_{SD}^2 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.70)\n\nEquation (10.70) is valid for \\( 0 \\leq V_{SD} \\leq V_{SD}(sat). \\)\n\n\n**Figure 10.49** | Cross section and bias configuration for a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET.\n\nEquation (10.70) can also be written as\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{k'_p}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot \\left[ 2(V_{SG} + V_T)V_{SD} - V_{SD}^2 \\right] = K_p \\left[ 2(V_{SG} + V_T)V_{SD} - V_{SD}^2 \\right] \\tag{10.71}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( K_p = \\mu_p C_{ox} \\) is the process conduction parameter for the p-channel MOSFET and \\( K_p = (W \\mu_p C_{ox})/(2L) = (k'_p/2) \\cdot (W/L) \\) is the conduction parameter.\n\nWhen the transistor is biased in the saturation region, the I–V relation is given by\n\n\\[\nI_D(sat) = \\frac{W \\mu_p C_{ox}}{2L} (V_{SG} + V_T)^2 \\tag{10.72}\n\\]\n\nEquation (10.72) is valid for \\( V_{SD} \\geq V_{SD} (sat) \\).\n\nEquation (10.72) can also be written as\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{k'_p}{2} \\cdot \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot (V_{SG} + V_T)^2 = K_p (V_{SG} + V_T)^2 \\tag{10.73}\n\\]\n\nThe source-to-drain saturation voltage is given by\n\n\\[\nV_{SD}(sat) = V_{SG} + V_T \\tag{10.74}\n\\]\n\nNote the change in the sign in front of \\( V_T \\) and note that the mobility is now the mobility of the holes in the hole inversion layer charge. Keep in mind that \\( V_T \\) is negative for a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and positive for a depletion mode p-channel device.\n\nOne assumption we made in the derivation of the current–voltage relationship was that the charge neutrality condition given by Equation (10.50) was valid over the entire length of the channel. We implicitly assumed that \\( Q_{ox}(max) \\) was constant along the length of the channel. The space charge width, however, varies between source and drain due to the drain-to-source voltage; it is widest at the drain when \\( V_{DS} > 0 \\). A change in the space charge density along the channel length must be balanced by a corresponding change in the inversion layer charge. An increase in the space charge width means that the inversion layer charge is reduced, implying that the drain current and drain-to-source saturation voltage are less than the ideal values. The actual saturation drain current may be as much as 20 percent less than the predicted value due to this bulk charge effect.\n\n### 10.3.4 Transconductance\n\nThe MOSFET transconductance is defined as the change in drain current with respect to the corresponding change in gate voltage, or\n\n\\[\ng_m = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}} \\tag{10.75}\n\\]\n\nThe transconductance is sometimes referred to as the transistor gain.\n\nIf we consider an n-channel MOSFET operating in the nonsaturation region, then using Equation (10.62), we have\n\n\\[\ng_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}} = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{L} \\cdot V_{DS}\n\\]\n\n(10.76)\n\nThe transconductance increases linearly with \\( V_{DS} \\) but is independent of \\( V_{GS} \\) in the nonsaturation region.\n\nThe I–V characteristics of an n-channel MOSFET in the saturation region are given by Equation (10.66). The transconductance in this region of operation is given by\n\n\\[\ng_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_D(\\text{sat})}{\\partial V_{GS}} = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{L} \\cdot (V_{GS} - V_T)\n\\]\n\n(10.77)\n\nIn the saturation region, the transconductance is a linear function of \\( V_{GS} \\) and is independent of \\( V_{DS} \\).\n\nThe transconductance is a function of the geometry of the device as well as of carrier mobility and threshold voltage. The transconductance increases as the width of the device increases, and it also increases as the channel length and oxide thickness decrease. In the design of MOSFET circuits, the size of the transistor, in particular the channel width \\( W \\), is an important engineering design parameter.\n\n### 10.3.5 Substrate Bias Effects\n\nIn all of our analyses so far, the substrate, or body, has been connected to the source and held at ground potential. In MOSFET circuits, the source and body may not be at the same potential. Figure 10.50a shows an n-channel MOSFET and the associated double-subscripted voltage variables. The source-to-substrate pn junction must always be zero or reverse biased, so \\( V_{SB} \\) must always be greater than or equal to zero.\n\n\n**Figure 10.50** (a) Applied voltages on an n-channel MOSFET. (b) Energy-band diagram at inversion point when \\( V_{SB} = 0 \\). (c) Energy-band diagram at inversion point when \\( V_{SB} > 0 \\) is applied.\n\nIf \\( V_{SB} = 0 \\), threshold is defined as the condition when \\( \\phi_s = 2\\phi_{fp} \\) as we discussed previously and as shown in Figure 10.50b. When \\( V_{SB} > 0 \\) the surface will still try to invert when \\( \\phi_s = 2\\phi_{fp} \\). However, these electrons are at a higher potential energy than are the electrons in the source. The newly created electrons will move laterally and flow out of the source terminal. When \\( \\phi_s = 2\\phi_{fp} + V_{SB} \\), the surface reaches an equilibrium inversion condition. The energy-band diagram for this condition is shown in Figure 10.50c. The curve represented as \\( E_F \\) is the Fermi level from the p substrate through the reverse-biased source–substrate junction to the source contact.\n\nThe space charge region width under the oxide increases from the original \\( x_{dT} \\) value when a reverse-biased source–substrate junction voltage is applied. With an applied \\( V_{SB} > 0 \\), there is more charge associated with this region. Considering the charge neutrality condition through the MOS structure, the positive charge on the top metal gate must increase to compensate for the increased negative space charge in order to reach the threshold inversion point. So when \\( V_{SB} > 0 \\), the threshold voltage of the n-channel MOSFET increases.\n\nWhen \\( V_{SB} = 0 \\), we had\n\n\\[\nQ'_{SD} (\\text{max}) = -eN_ax_{dT} = -\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{ox} N_a(2\\phi_{fp})}\n\\]\n\n(10.78)\n\nWhen \\( V_{SB} > 0 \\), the space charge width increases and we now have\n\n\\[\nQ'_{SD} = -eN_ax_d = -\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{ox} N_a(2\\phi_{fp} + V_{SB})}\n\\]\n\n(10.79)\n\nThe change in the space charge density is then\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Q'_{SD} = -\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{ox} N_a} \\left[ \\sqrt{2\\phi_{fp} + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{fp}} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.80)\n\nTo reach the threshold condition, the applied gate voltage must be increased. The change in threshold voltage can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V_T = -\\frac{\\Delta Q'_{SD}}{C_{ox}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{ox} N_a}}{C_{ox}} \\left[ \\sqrt{2\\phi_{fp} + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{fp}} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.81)\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta V_T = V_T(V_{SB} > 0) - V_T(V_{SB} = 0) \\). We may note that \\( V_{SB} \\) must always be positive so that, for the n-channel device, \\( \\Delta V_T \\) is always positive. The threshold voltage of the n-channel MOSFET will increase as a function of the source–substrate junction voltage.\n\nFrom Equation (10.81), we may define\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{ox} N_a}}{C_{ox}}\n\\]\n\n(10.82)\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma \\) is defined as the body-effect coefficient. Equation (10.81) may then be written as\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V_T = \\gamma \\left[ \\sqrt{2\\phi_{fp} + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{fp}} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(10.83)\n\nIf a body or substrate bias is applied to a p-channel device, the threshold voltage is shifted to more negative values. Because the threshold voltage of a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET is negative, a body voltage will increase the applied negative gate voltage required to create inversion. The same general observation was made for the n-channel MOSFET.",

    "text": "## 10.4 FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS\n\nIn many applications, the MOSFET is used in a linear amplifier circuit. A small-signal equivalent circuit for the MOSFET is needed in order to mathematically analyze the electronic circuit. The equivalent circuit contains capacitances and resistances that introduce frequency effects. We initially develop a small-signal equivalent circuit and then discuss the physical factors that limit the frequency response of the MOSFET. A transistor cutoff frequency, which is a figure of merit, is then defined and an expression derived for this factor.\n\n### 10.4.1 Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit\n\nThe small-signal equivalent circuit of the MOSFET is constructed from the basic MOSFET geometry. A model based on the inherent capacitances and resistances within the transistor structure, along with elements that represent the basic device equations, is shown in Figure 10.52. One simplifying assumption we will make in the equivalent circuit is that the source and substrate are both tied to ground potential.\n\n**Figure 10.52** Inherent resistances and capacitances in the n-channel MOSFET structure.\n\nTwo of the capacitances connected to the gate are inherent in the device. These capacitances are \\( C_{gs} \\) and \\( C_{gb} \\) which represent the interaction between the gate and the channel charge near the source and drain terminals, respectively. The remaining two gate capacitances, \\( C_{gd} \\) and \\( C_{db} \\), are parasitic or overlap capacitances. In real devices, the gate oxide will overlap the source and drain contacts because of tolerance or fabrication factors. As we will see, the drain overlap capacitance—\\( C_{db} \\) in particular—will lower the frequency response of the device. The parameter \\( C_{ds} \\) is the drain-to-substrate pn junction capacitance, and \\( r_s \\) and \\( r_d \\) are the series resistances associated with the source and drain terminals. The small-signal channel current is controlled by the internal gate-to-source voltage through the transconductance.\n\nThe small-signal equivalent circuit for the n-channel common-source MOSFET is shown in Figure 10.53. The voltage \\( V_{gs}' \\) is the internal gate-to-source voltage that\n\n**Figure 10.53** Small-signal equivalent circuit of a common-source n-channel MOSFET.\n\ncontrols the channel current. The parameters \\( C_{gs} \\) and \\( C_{gd} \\) are the total gate-to-source and total gate-to-drain capacitances. One parameter, \\( r_{ds} \\), shown in Figure 10.53, is not shown in Figure 10.52. This resistance is associated with the slope \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\). In the ideal MOSFET biased in the saturation region, \\( I_D \\) is independent of \\( V_{DS} \\) so that \\( r_{ds} \\) would be infinite. In short-channel-length devices, in particular, \\( r_{ds} \\) is finite because of channel length modulation, which we will consider in the next chapter.\n\nA simplified small-signal equivalent circuit valid at low frequency is shown in Figure 10.54. The series resistances, \\( r_s \\) and \\( r_d \\), have been neglected, so the drain current is essentially only a function of the gate-to-source voltage through the transconductance. The input gate impedance is infinite in this simplified model.\n\nThe source resistance \\( r_s \\) can have a significant effect on the transistor characteristics. Figure 10.55 shows a simplified, low-frequency equivalent circuit including \\( r_s \\) but neglecting \\( r_{ds} \\). The drain current is given by\n\n\\[\nI_d = g_m V'_{gs}\n\\]\n\n(10.84)\n\nand the relation between \\( V_{gs} \\) and \\( V'_{gs} \\) can be found from\n\n\\[\nV_{gs} = V'_{gs} + g_m V'_{gs} r_s = (1 + g_m r_s) V'_{gs}\n\\]\n\n(10.85)\n\n\n**Figure 10.54** | Simplified, low-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit of a common-source n-channel MOSFET.\n\n\n**Figure 10.55** | Simplified, low-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit of common-source n-channel MOSFET including source resistance \\( r_s \\).\n\nThe drain current from Equation (10.84) can now be written as\n\n\\[\nI_d = \\left( \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m r_s'} \\right)_{V_{gs} = V_{gs}'} = g_m' V_{gs}'\n\\]\n\n(10.86)\n\nThe source resistance reduces the effective transconductance or transistor gain.\n\nThe equivalent circuit of the p-channel MOSFET is exactly the same as that of the n-channel except that all voltage polarities and current directions are reversed. The same capacitances and resistances that are in the n-channel model apply to the p-channel model.\n\n### 10.4.2 Frequency Limitation Factors and Cutoff Frequency\n\nThere are two basic frequency limitation factors in the MOSFET. The first factor is the channel transit time. If we assume that carriers are traveling at their saturation drift velocity \\( v_{sat} \\), then the transit time is \\( \\tau = L/v_{sat} \\) where \\( L \\) is the channel length. If \\( v_{sat} = 10^7 \\) cm/s and \\( L = 1 \\) μm, then \\( \\tau = 10 \\) ps, which translates into a maximum frequency of 100 GHz. This frequency is much larger than the typical maximum frequency response of a MOSFET. The transit time of carriers through the channel is usually not the limiting factor in the frequency responses of MOSFETs.\n\nThe second limiting factor is the gate or capacitance charging time. If we neglect \\( r_g, r_{ds}, \\) and \\( C_{db} \\), the resulting equivalent small-signal circuit is shown in Figure 10.56 where \\( R_L \\) is a load resistance.\n\nThe input gate impedance in this equivalent circuit is no longer infinite. Summing currents at the input gate node, we have\n\n\\[\nI_i = j \\omega C_{gsT} V_{gs} + j \\omega C_{gdT} (V_{gs} - V_d)\n\\]\n\n(10.87)\n\nwhere \\( I_i \\) is the input current. Likewise, summing currents at the output drain node, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_d}{R_L} + g_m V_{gs} + j \\omega C_{gdT} (V_d - V_{gs}) = 0\n\\]\n\n(10.88)\n\n\n**Figure 10.56** | High-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit of common-source n-channel MOSFET.\n\n**Figure 10.57** | Small-signal equivalent circuit including Miller capacitance.\n\nCombining Equations (10.87) and (10.88) to eliminate the voltage variable \\( V_b \\), we can determine the input current as\n\n\\[\nI_i = j\\omega \\left[ C_{gpr} + C_{gd} \\left( 1 + \\frac{g_m R_L}{1 + j\\omega R_L C_{gd}} \\right) \\right] V_x\n\\]\n\n(10.89)\n\nNormally, \\(\\omega R_L C_{gd}\\) is much less than unity; therefore, we may neglect the \\((j\\omega R_L C_{gd})\\) term in the denominator. Equation (10.89) then simplifies to\n\n\\[\nI_i = j\\omega [C_{gpr} + C_{gd}(1 + g_m R_L)] V_x\n\\]\n\n(10.90)\n\nFigure 10.57 shows the equivalent circuit with the equivalent input impedance described by Equation (10.90). The parameter \\( C_M \\) is the Miller capacitance and is given by\n\n\\[\nC_M = C_{gd}(1 + g_m R_L)\n\\]\n\n(10.91)\n\nThe serious effect of the drain overlap capacitance now becomes apparent. When the transistor is operating in the saturation region, \\( C_{gd} \\) essentially becomes zero, but \\( C_{gde} \\) is a constant. This parasitic capacitance is multiplied by the gain of the transistor and can become a significant factor in the input impedance.\n\nThe cutoff frequency \\( f_T \\) is defined to be the frequency at which the magnitude of the current gain of the device is unity, or when the magnitude of the input current \\( I_i \\) is equal to the ideal load current \\( I_d \\). From Figure 10.57, we can see that\n\n\\[\nI_i = j\\omega (C_{gpr} + C_M) V_x\n\\]\n\n(10.92)\n\nand the ideal load current is\n\n\\[\nI_d = g_m V_x\n\\]\n\n(10.93)\n\nThe magnitude of the current gain is then\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{I_d}{I_i} \\right| = \\frac{g_m}{2\\pi f (C_{gpr} + C_M)}\n\\]\n\n(10.94)\n\nSetting the magnitude of the current gain equal to unity at the cutoff frequency, we find\n\n\\[\nf_T = \\frac{g_m}{2\\pi (C_{gpr} + C_M)} = \\frac{g_m}{2\\pi C_G}\n\\]\n\n(10.95)\n\nwhere \\( C_G \\) is the equivalent input gate capacitance.",

However, there is one MOS technology...\n\nthat is used extensively, for which the basic fabrication techniques must be considered in order to understand essential characteristics of these devices and circuits. The MOS technology we consider briefly is the complementary MOS, or CMOS, process.\n\nWe have considered the physics of both n-channel and p-channel enhancement mode MOSFETs. Both devices are used in a CMOS inverter, which is the basis of CMOS digital logic circuits. The dc power dissipation in a digital circuit can be reduced to very low levels by using a complementary p-channel and n-channel pair.\n\nIt is necessary to form electrically isolated p- and n-substrate regions in an integrated circuit to accommodate the n- and p-channel transistors. The p-well process has been a commonly used technique for CMOS circuits. The process starts with a fairly low doped n-type silicon substrate in which the p-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. A diffused p region, called a p well, is formed in which the n-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. In most cases, the p-type substrate doping level must be larger than the n-type substrate doping level to obtain the desired threshold voltages. The larger p doping can easily compensate the initial n doping to form the p well. A simplified cross section of the p-well CMOS structure is shown in Figure 10.58a. The notation FOX stands for field oxide, which is a relatively thick oxide separating the devices. The FOX prevents either the n or p substrate from becoming inverted and helps maintain isolation between the two devices. In practice, additional processing steps must be included; for example, providing connections so that the p well and n substrate can be electrically connected to the appropriate voltages. The n substrate must always be at a higher potential than the p well; therefore, this pn junction will always be reverse biased.\n\n**Figure 10.58** CMOS structures: (a) p well, (b) n well, and (c) twin well.  \n*(From Yang [22].)*\n\n- **(a)** p well\n- **(b)** n well\n- **(c)** twin well\n\nDescription of Figures\n\n- **Poly-Si gate**: Represents the gate material used in the MOSFET.\n- **FOX**: Field oxide, used for isolation.\n- **p well**: Region where n-channel MOSFET is fabricated.\n- **n well**: Region where p-channel MOSFET is fabricated.\n- **n substrate**: Base material for p well.\n- **p substrate**: Base material for n well.\n- **p or n substrate**: Base material for twin well configuration.\n\nWith ion implantation now being extensively used for threshold voltage control, both the n-well CMOS process and twin-well CMOS process can be used. The n-well CMOS process, shown in Figure 10.58b, starts with an optimized p-type substrate that is used to form the n-channel MOSFETs. (The n-channel MOSFETs, in general, have superior characteristics, so this starting point should yield excellent n-channel devices.) The n well is then added, in which the p-channel devices are fabricated. The n-well doping can be controlled by ion implantation.\n\nThe twin-well CMOS process, shown in Figure 10.58c, allows both the p-well and n-well regions to be optimally doped to control the threshold voltage and transconductance of each transistor. The twin-well process allows a higher packing density because of self-aligned channel stops.\n\nOne major problem in CMOS circuits has been latch-up. **Latch-up** refers to a high-current, low-voltage condition that may occur in a four-layer pnpn structure. Figure 10.59a shows the circuit of a CMOS inverter and Figure 10.59b shows a simplified integrated circuit layout of the inverter circuit. In the CMOS layout, p⁺ source to n substrate to p well to n⁺ source forms such a four-layer structure.\n\nThe equivalent circuit of this four-layer structure is shown in Figure 10.60. The silicon-controlled rectifier action involves the interaction of the parasitic pnp and npn bipolar transistors. Bipolar transistors are discussed in Chapter 12. The npn transistor corresponds to the vertical n⁺-source to p-well to n-substrate structure and the pnp transistor corresponds to the lateral p-well to n-substrate to p⁺-source structure. Under normal CMOS operation, both parasitic bipolar transistors are cut off. However, under certain conditions, avalanche breakdown may occur in the p-well to n-substrate junction, driving both bipolar transistors into saturation. This high-current, low-voltage condition—latch-up—can sustain itself by positive feedback. The condition can prevent the CMOS circuit from operating and can also cause permanent damage and burnout of the circuit.\n\nLatch-up can be prevented if the product \\( \\beta_n \\beta_p \\) is less than unity at all times, where \\( \\beta_n \\) and \\( \\beta_p \\) are the common-emitter current gains of the npn and pnp parasitic transistors.\n\n**Figure 10.59** (a) CMOS inverter circuit.

(b) The two-transistor equivalent circuit of the four-layered pnpn device.\n\nbipolar transistors, respectively. One method of preventing latch-up is to “kill” the minority carrier lifetime. Minority carrier lifetime degradation can be accomplished by gold doping or neutron irradiation, either of which introduces deep traps within the semiconductor. The deep traps increase the excess minority carrier recombination rate and reduce current gain. A second method of preventing latch-up is by using proper circuit layout techniques. If the two bipolar transistors can be effectively decoupled, then latch-up can be minimized or prevented. The two parasitic bipolar transistors can also be decoupled by using a different fabrication technology. The silicon-on-insulator technology, for example, allows the n-channel and the p-channel MOSFETs to be isolated from each other by an insulator. This isolation decouples the parasitic bipolar transistors.",

    "text": "# Chapter 6: Nonequilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors\n\nOur discussion of the physics of semiconductors in Chapter 4 was based on thermal equilibrium. When a voltage is applied or a current exists in a semiconductor device, the semiconductor is operating under nonequilibrium conditions. In our discussion of current transport in Chapter 5, we did not address nonequilibrium conditions but implicitly assumed that equilibrium was not significantly disturbed. Excess electrons in the conduction band and excess holes in the valence band may exist in addition to the thermal-equilibrium concentrations if an external excitation is applied to the semiconductor. In this chapter, we discuss the behavior of nonequilibrium electron and hole concentrations as functions of time and space coordinates.\n\nExcess electrons and excess holes do not move independently of each other. These excess carriers diffuse, drift, and recombine with the same effective diffusion coefficient, drift mobility, and lifetime. This phenomenon is called ambipolar transport. We develop the ambipolar transport equation that describes the behavior of excess electrons and holes. Excess carriers dominate the electrical properties of a semiconductor material, and the behavior of excess carriers is fundamental to the operation of semiconductor devices.",

    "text": "## 6.1. Carrier Generation and Recombination\n\nIn this chapter, we discuss carrier generation and recombination, which we can define as follows: **generation** is the process whereby electrons and holes are created, and **recombination** is the process whereby electrons and holes are annihilated.\n\nAny deviation from thermal equilibrium will tend to change the electron and hole concentrations in a semiconductor. A sudden increase in temperature, for example, will increase the rate at which electrons and holes are thermally generated so that their concentrations will change with time until new equilibrium values are reached. An external excitation, such as light (a flux of photons), can also generate electrons and holes, creating a nonequilibrium condition. To understand the generation and recombination processes, we first consider direct band-to-band generation and recombination, and then, later, the effect of allowed electronic energy states within the bandgap, referred to as traps or recombination centers.\n\n### 6.1.1 The Semiconductor in Equilibrium\n\nWe have determined the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. In thermal equilibrium, these concentrations are independent of time. However, electrons are continually being thermally excited from the valence band into the conduction band by the random nature of the thermal process. At the same time, electrons moving randomly through the crystal in the conduction band may come in close proximity to holes and “fall” into the empty states in the valence band. This recombination process annihilates both the electron and hole. Since the net carrier concentrations are independent of time in thermal equilibrium, the rate at which electrons and holes are generated and the rate at which they recombine must be equal. The generation and recombination processes are schematically shown in Figure 6.1.\n\n\n**Figure 6.1** | Electron–hole generation and recombination.\n\n\nLet $G_{n0}$ and $G_{p0}$ be the thermal-generation rates of electrons and holes, respectively, given in units of \\#$/\\text{cm}^3\\cdot \\text{s}$. For the direct band-to-band generation, the electrons and holes are created in pairs, so we must have that\n\n\\[\nG_{n0} = G_{p0}\n\\]\n(6.1)\n\nLet $R_{n0}$ and $R_{p0}$ be the recombination rates of electrons and holes, respectively, for a semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, again given in units of \\#$/\\text{cm}^3\\cdot \\text{s}$. In direct band-to-band recombination, electrons and holes recombine in pairs, so that\n\n\\[\nR_{n0} = R_{p0}\n\\]\n(6.2)\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, the concentrations of electrons and holes are independent of time; therefore, the generation and recombination rates are equal, so we have\n\n\\[\nG_{n0} = G_{p0} = R_{n0} = R_{p0}\n\\]\n(6.3)\n\n\n### 6.1.2 Excess Carrier Generation and Recombination\n\nAdditional notation is introduced in this chapter. Table 6.1 lists some of the more pertinent symbols used throughout the chapter. Other symbols will be defined as we advance through the chapter.\n\nElectrons in the valence band may be excited into the conduction band when, for example, high-energy photons are incident on a semiconductor. When this happens, not only is an electron created in the conduction band, but a hole is created in the valence band; thus, an electron--hole pair is generated. The additional electrons and holes created are called \\textit{excess electrons} and \\textit{excess holes}.\n\nThe excess electrons and holes are generated by an external force at a particular rate. Let $g'_n$ be the generation rate of excess electrons and $g'_p$ be that of excess holes. These generation rates also have units of \\#$/\\text{cm}^3\\cdot \\text{s}$. For the direct band-to-band generation, the excess electrons and holes are also created in pairs, so we must have\n\n\\[\ng'_n = g'_p\n\\]\n(6.4)\n\n**Table 6.1** | Relevant notation used in Chapter 6\n\n| **Symbol**           | **Definition**                                                             |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $n_0$, $p_0$         | Thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations (independent of time and also usually position) |\n| $n$, $p$             | Total electron and hole concentrations (may be functions of time and/or position)  |\n| $\\delta n = n - n_0$ | Excess electron and hole concentrations (may be functions of time and/or position) |\n| $\\delta p = p - p_0$ | Excess electron and hole concentrations (may be functions of time and/or position) |\n| $g_n'$, $g_p'$       | Excess electron and hole generation rates                                          |\n| $R_n'$, $R_p'$       | Excess electron and hole recombination rates                                       |\n| $\\tau_{n0}$, $\\tau_{p0}$ | Excess minority carrier electron and hole lifetimes                            |\n\n- **$n_0$ and $p_0$** are thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, respectively.  \n  They are independent of time and also usually position.\n\n- **$n$ and $p$** represent the total electron and hole concentrations.  \n  These may be functions of time and/or position.\n\n- **$\\delta n = n - n_0$** represents the excess electron concentration,  \n  and **$\\delta p = p - p_0$** represents the excess hole concentration.  \n  These may also vary with time and/or position.\n\n- **$g_n'$ and $g_p'$** denote the generation rates of excess electrons and holes, respectively.\n\n- **$R_n'$ and $R_p'$** denote the recombination rates of excess electrons and holes.\n\n- **$\\tau_{n0}$ and $\\tau_{p0}$** are the lifetimes of excess minority carrier electrons and holes, respectively.\n\nWhen excess electrons and holes are created, the concentration of electrons in the conduction band and of holes in the valence band increase above their thermal-equilibrium value. We may write\n\n\\[\nn = n_0 + \\delta n \\tag{6.5a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\np = p_0 + \\delta p \\tag{6.5b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) are the thermal-equilibrium concentrations, and \\( \\delta n \\) and \\( \\delta p \\) are the excess electron and hole concentrations. Figure 6.2 shows the excess electron–hole generation process and the resulting carrier concentrations. The external force has perturbed the equilibrium condition so that the semiconductor is no longer in thermal equilibrium. We may note from Equations (6.5a) and (6.5b) that, in a nonequilibrium condition, \\( np \\neq n_0p_0 = n_i^2 \\).\n\nA steady-state generation of excess electrons and holes will not cause a continual buildup of the carrier concentrations. As in the case of thermal equilibrium, an electron in the conduction band may “fall down” into the valence band, leading to the process of excess electron–hole recombination. Figure 6.3 shows this process. The\n\n**Figure 6.2** | Creation of excess electron and hole densities by photons.\n\n**Figure 6.3** | Recombination of excess carriers reestablishing thermal equilibrium.\n\nRecombination rate for excess electrons is denoted by \\( R'_n \\) and for excess holes by \\( R'_p \\). Both parameters have units of \\(\\#/\\text{cm}^3\\cdot\\text{s}\\). The excess electrons and holes recombine in pairs, so the recombination rates must be equal. We can then write\n\n\\[\nR'_n = R'_p\n\\tag{6.6}\n\\]\n\nIn the direct band-to-band recombination that we are considering, the recombination occurs spontaneously; thus, the probability of an electron and hole recombining is constant with time. The rate at which electrons recombine must be proportional to the electron concentration and must also be proportional to the hole concentration. If there are no electrons or holes, there can be no recombination.\n\nThe net rate of change in the electron concentration can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \\alpha_r \\left[ n_i^2 - n(t)p(t) \\right]\n\\tag{6.7}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nn(t) = n_0 + \\delta n(t)\n\\tag{6.8a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\np(t) = p_0 + \\delta p(t)\n\\tag{6.8b}\n\\]\n\nThe first term, \\(\\alpha_r n_i^2\\), in Equation (6.7) is the thermal-equilibrium generation rate. Since excess electrons and holes are created and recombine in pairs, we have that \\(\\delta n(t) = \\delta p(t)\\). (Excess electron and hole concentrations are equal so we can simply use the phrase excess carriers to mean either.) The thermal-equilibrium parameters, \\(n_0\\) and \\(p_0\\), are independent of time; therefore, Equation (6.7) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d[\\delta n(t)]}{dt} = \\alpha_r \\left[ n_i^2 - (n_0 + \\delta n(t))(p_0 + \\delta p(t)) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -\\alpha_r \\delta n(t)(n_0 + p_0) + \\delta n(t)\n\\tag{6.9}\n\\]\n\nEquation (6.9) can easily be solved if we impose the condition of low-level injection. Low-level injection puts limits on the magnitude of the excess carrier concentration compared with the thermal-equilibrium carrier concentrations. In an extrinsic n-type material, we generally have \\(n_0 \\gg p_0\\) and, in an extrinsic p-type material, we generally have \\(p_0 \\gg n_0\\). Low-level injection means that the excess carrier concentration is much less than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentration. Conversely, high-level injection occurs when the excess carrier concentration becomes comparable to or greater than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentrations.\n\nIf we consider a p-type material (\\(p_0 \\gg n_0\\)) under low-level injection (\\(\\delta n(t) \\ll p_0\\)), then Equation (6.9) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d[\\delta n(t)]}{dt} = -\\alpha_r p_0 \\delta n(t)\n\\tag{6.10}\n\\]\n\nThe solution to the equation is an exponential decay from the initial excess concentration, or\n\n\\[\n\\delta n(t) = \\delta n(0)e^{-\\alpha_r p_0 t} = \\delta n(0)e^{-t/\\tau}\n\\tag{6.11}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\tau_0 = ( \\alpha_r p_0 )^{-1}\\) and is a constant for the low-level injection. Equation (6.11) describes the decay of excess minority carrier electrons so that \\(\\tau_0\\) is often referred to as the **excess minority carrier lifetime**. \n\nThe recombination rate—which is defined as a positive quantity—of excess minority carrier electrons can be written, using Equation (6.10), as\n\n\\[\nR'_n = -\\frac{d(\\delta n(t))}{dt} = \\alpha_r p_0 \\delta n(t) = \\frac{\\delta n(t)}{\\tau_{n0}}\n\\]\n\n(6.12)\n\nFor the direct band-to-band recombination, the excess majority carrier holes recombine at the same rate, so that for the p-type material\n\n\\[\nR'_n = R'_p = \\frac{\\delta n(t)}{\\tau_{n0}}\n\\]\n\n(6.13)\n\nIn the case of an n-type material \\((n_0 \\gg p_0)\\) under low-level injection \\((\\delta n(t) \\ll n_0)\\), the decay of minority carrier holes occurs with a time constant \\(\\tau_{p0} = (\\alpha_r n_0)^{-1}\\), where \\(\\tau_{p0}\\) is also referred to as the excess minority carrier lifetime. The recombination rate of the majority carrier electrons will be the same as that of the minority carrier holes, so we have\n\n\\[\nR'_n = R'_p = \\frac{\\delta n(t)}{\\tau_{p0}}\n\\]\n\n(6.14)\n\nThe generation rates of excess carriers are not functions of electron or hole concentrations.

    "text": "## 6.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF EXCESS CARRIERS\n\nThe generation and recombination rates of excess carriers are important parameters, but how the excess carriers behave with time and in space in the presence of electric fields and density gradients is of equal importance. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the excess electrons and holes do not move independently of each other, but they diffuse and drift with the same effective diffusion coefficient and with the same effective mobility. This phenomenon is called ambipolar transport. The question that must be answered is what is the effective diffusion coefficient and what is the effective mobility that characterizes the behavior of these excess carriers? To answer these questions, we must develop the continuity equations for the carriers and then develop the ambipolar transport equations.\n\nThe final results show that, for an extrinsic semiconductor under low injection (this concept will be defined in the analysis), the effective diffusion coefficient and mobility parameters are those of the minority carrier. This result is thoroughly developed in the following derivations. As will be seen in the following chapters, the behavior of the excess carriers has a profound impact on the characteristics of semiconductor devices.\n\n### 6.2.1 Continuity Equations\n\nThe continuity equations for electrons and holes are developed in this section. Figure 6.4 shows a differential volume element in which a one-dimensional hole-particle flux is entering the differential element at \\( x \\) and is leaving the element at \\( x + dx \\). The parameter \\( F_{px}^{+} \\) is the hole-particle flux, or flow, and has units of number of holes/cm\\(^2\\)-s. For the \\( x \\) component of the particle current density shown, we may write\n\n\\[\nF_{px}^{+}(x + dx) = F_{px}^{+}(x) + \\frac{\\partial F_{px}^{+}}{\\partial x} \\cdot dx\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(6.15)\n\\]\n\n\n**Figure 6.4** | Differential volume showing \\( x \\) component of the hole-particle flux.\n\nThis equation is a Taylor expansion of \\( F^+_p(x + dx) \\), where the differential length \\( dx \\) is small, so that only the first two terms in the expansion are significant. The net increase in the number of holes per unit time within the differential volume element due to the \\( x \\)-component of hole flux is given by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} dx \\, dy \\, dz = [F^+_p(x) - F^+_p(x + dx)] dy \\, dz = -\\frac{\\partial F^+_p}{\\partial x} dx \\, dy \\, dz\n\\]\n\n(6.16)\n\nIf \\( F^+_p(x) > F^+_p(x + dx) \\), for example, there will be a net increase in the number of holes in the differential volume element with time. If we generalize to a three-dimensional hole flux, then the right side of Equation (6.16) may be written as \\(-\\nabla \\cdot F^+_p \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz\\), where \\(\\nabla \\cdot F^+_p\\) is the divergence of the flux vector. We will limit ourselves to a one-dimensional analysis.\n\nThe generation rate and recombination rate of holes will also affect the hole concentration in the differential volume. The net increase in the number of holes per unit time in the differential volume element is then given by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} dx \\, dy \\, dz = -\\frac{\\partial F^+_p}{\\partial x} dx \\, dy \\, dz + g_p \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz - \\frac{p}{\\tau_{p0}} dx \\, dy \\, dz\n\\]\n\n(6.17)\n\nwhere \\( p \\) is the density of holes. The first term on the right side of Equation (6.17) is the increase in the number of holes per unit time due to the hole flux, the second term is the increase in the number of holes per unit time due to the generation of holes, and the last term is the decrease in the number of holes per unit time due to the recombination of holes. The recombination rate for holes is given by \\( p/\\tau_{p0} \\), where \\(\\tau_{p0}\\) includes the thermal-equilibrium carrier lifetime and the excess carrier lifetime.\n\nIf we divide both sides of Equation (6.17) by the differential volume \\( dx \\, dy \\, dz \\), the net increase in the hole concentration per unit time is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial F^+_p}{\\partial x} + g_p - \\frac{p}{\\tau_{p0}}\n\\]\n\n(6.18)\n\nEquation (6.18) is known as the continuity equation for holes.\n\nSimilarly, the one-dimensional continuity equation for electrons is given by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial F^-_n}{\\partial x} + g_n - \\frac{n}{\\tau_{n0}}\n\\]\n\n(6.19)\n\nwhere \\( F^-_n \\) is the electron-particle flow, or flux, also given in units of number of electrons/cm\\(^2\\)-s.\n\n### 6.2.2 Time-Dependent Diffusion Equations\n\nIn Chapter 5, we derived the hole and electron current densities, which are given, in one dimension, by\n\n\\[\nJ_p = e\\mu_p pE - eD_p \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\n(6.20)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nJ_n = e\\mu_n nE + eD_n \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\n(6.21)\n\nIf we divide the hole current density by \\( (+e) \\) and the electron current density by \\( (-e) \\), we obtain each particle flux. These equations become\n\n\\[\n\\frac{J_p}{(+e)} = F^+ = \\mu_p pE - D_p \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n(6.22)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{J_n}{(-e)} = F^- = -\\mu_n nE - D_n \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n(6.23)\n\nTaking the divergence of Equations (6.22) and (6.23), and substituting back into the continuity equations of (6.18) and (6.19), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -\\mu_p \\frac{\\partial (pE)}{\\partial x} + D_p \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} + g_p - \\frac{p}{\\tau_p}\n\\]\n(6.24)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = \\mu_n \\frac{\\partial (nE)}{\\partial x} + D_n \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2} + g_n - \\frac{n}{\\tau_n}\n\\]\n(6.25)\n\nKeeping in mind that we are limiting ourselves to a one-dimensional analysis, we can expand the derivative of the product as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial (pE)}{\\partial x} = E \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + p \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n(6.26)\n\nIn a more generalized three-dimensional analysis, Equation (6.26) would have to be replaced by a vector identity. Equations (6.24) and (6.25) can be written in the form\n\n\\[\nD_p \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} - \\mu_p \\left( E \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + p \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} \\right) + g_p - \\frac{p}{\\tau_p} = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n(6.27)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nD_n \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2} + \\mu_n \\left( E \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} + n \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} \\right) + g_n - \\frac{n}{\\tau_n} = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n(6.28)\n\nEquations (6.27) and (6.28) are the time-dependent diffusion equations for holes and electrons, respectively. Since both the hole concentration \\( p \\) and the electron concentration \\( n \\) contain the excess concentrations, Equations (6.27) and (6.28) describe the space and time behavior of the excess carriers.\n\nThe hole and electron concentrations are functions of both the thermal equilibrium and the excess values, which are given in Equations (6.5a) and (6.5b). The thermal-equilibrium concentrations, \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\), are not functions of time. For the special case of a homogeneous semiconductor, \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) are also independent of the space coordinates.

This electric field term appears in the time-dependent diffusion equations given by Equations (6.29) and (6.30). If a pulse of excess electrons and a pulse of excess holes are created at a particular point in a semiconductor with an applied electric field, the excess holes and electrons will tend to drift in opposite directions. However, because the electrons and holes are charged particles, any separation will induce an internal electric field between the two sets of particles. This internal electric field will create a force attracting the electrons and holes back toward each other. This effect is shown in Figure 6.5. The electric field term in Equations (6.29) and (6.30) is then composed of the externally applied field plus the induced internal field. This E-field may be written as\n\n\\[\nE = E_{\\text{app}} + E_{\\text{int}}\n\\]\n\n(6.31)\n\nwhere \\( E_{\\text{app}} \\) is the applied electric field and \\( E_{\\text{int}} \\) is the induced internal electric field.\n\nSince the internal E-field creates a force attracting the electrons and holes, this E-field will hold the pulses of excess electrons and excess holes together. The negatively charged electrons and positively charged holes then will drift or diffuse together with a single effective mobility or diffusion coefficient. This phenomenon is called **ambipolar diffusion** or **ambipolar transport**.\n\n### 6.3.1 Derivation of the Ambipolar Transport Equation\n\nThe time-dependent diffusion Equations (6.29) and (6.30) describe the behavior of the excess carriers. However, a third equation is required to relate the excess electron and hole concentrations to the internal electric field. This relation is Poisson’s equation, which may be written as\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot E_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{e(\\delta p - \\delta n)}{\\varepsilon_s} = \\frac{\\partial E_{\\text{int}}}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\n(6.32)\n\nwhere \\( \\varepsilon_s \\) is the permittivity of the semiconductor material.\n\n\n**Figure 6.5** | The creation of an internal electric field as excess electrons and holes tend to separate.\n\nTo make the solution of Equations (6.29), (6.30), and (6.32) more tractable, we need to make some approximations. We can show that only a relatively small internal electric field is sufficient to keep the excess electrons and holes drifting and diffusing together. Hence, we can assume that\n\n\\[\n|\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{int}}| \\ll |\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{appl}}|\n\\]\n\n(6.33)\n\nHowever, the \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{int}}\\) term may not be negligible. We will impose the condition of charge neutrality: We will assume that the excess electron concentration is just balanced by an equal excess hole concentration at any point in space and time. If this assumption were exactly true, there would be no induced internal electric field to keep the two sets of particles together. However, only a very small difference in the excess electron concentration and excess hole concentration will set up an internal E-field sufficient to keep the particles diffusing and drifting together. We can show that a 1 percent difference in \\(\\delta p\\) and \\(\\delta n\\), for example, will result in non-negligible values of the \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{int}}\\) term in Equations (6.29) and (6.30).\n\nWe can combine Equations (6.29) and (6.30) to eliminate the \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}\\) term. Considering Equations (6.1) and (6.4), we can define\n\n\\[\ng_n = g_p = g\n\\]\n\n(6.34)\n\nand considering Equations (6.2) and (6.6), we can define\n\n\\[\nR_n = \\frac{n}{\\tau_{n}} = R_p = \\frac{p}{\\tau_{p}} \\equiv R\n\\]\n\n(6.35)\n\nThe lifetimes in Equation (6.35) include the thermal-equilibrium carrier lifetimes and the excess carrier lifetimes. If we impose the charge neutrality condition, then \\(\\delta n \\approx \\delta p\\). We will denote both the excess electron and excess hole concentrations in Equations (6.29) and (6.30) by \\(\\delta n\\). We may then rewrite Equations (6.29) and (6.30) as\n\n\\[\nD_n \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta n)}{\\partial x^2} - \\mu_p \\left[ E \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial x} + p \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} \\right] + g - R = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(6.36)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nD_p \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta n)}{\\partial x^2} + \\mu_e \\left[ E \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial x} + n \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} \\right] + g - R = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(6.37)\n\nIf we multiply Equation (6.36) by \\(\\mu_n\\), multiply Equation (6.37) by \\(\\mu_p\\), and add the two equations, the \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\partial E / \\partial x\\) term will be eliminated. The result of this addition gives\n\n\\[\n(\\mu_n n D_n + \\mu_p D_p) \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta n)}{\\partial x^2} + (\\mu_n \\mu_p)(p - n) E \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ (\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p)(g - R) = (\\mu_n + \\mu_p) \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(6.38)\n\nIf we divide Equation (6.38) by the term \\((\\mu_n + \\mu_p)\\), this equation becomes\n\n\\[\nD' \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta n)}{\\partial x^2} + \\mu' E \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial x} + g - R = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(6.39)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nD' = \\frac{\\mu_n n D_n + \\mu_p D_p}{\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p}\n\\]\n(6.40)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\mu' = \\frac{\\mu_n \\mu_p (p - n)}{\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p}\n\\]\n(6.41)\n\nEquation (6.39) is called the **ambipolar transport equation** and describes the behavior of the excess electrons and holes in time and space. The parameter \\( D' \\) is called the **ambipolar diffusion coefficient** and \\( \\mu' \\) is called the **ambipolar mobility**.\n\nThe Einstein relation relates the mobility and diffusion coefficient by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mu_n}{D_n} = \\frac{\\mu_p}{D_p} = \\frac{e}{kT}\n\\]\n(6.42)\n\nUsing these relations, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient may be written in the form\n\n\\[\nD' = \\frac{D_n D_p (n + p)}{D_n n + D_p p}\n\\]\n(6.43)\n\nThe ambipolar diffusion coefficient, \\( D' \\), and the ambipolar mobility, \\( \\mu' \\), are functions of the electron and hole concentrations, \\( n \\) and \\( p \\), respectively. Since both \\( n \\) and \\( p \\) contain the excess carrier concentration \\( \\delta n \\), the coefficient in the ambipolar transport equation are not constants. The ambipolar transport equation, given by Equation (6.39), then, is a nonlinear differential equation.\n\n### 6.3.2 Limits of Extrinsic Doping and Low Injection\n\nThe ambipolar transport equation may be simplified and linearized by considering an extrinsic semiconductor and by considering low-level injection. The ambipolar diffusion coefficient, from Equation (6.43), may be written as\n\n\\[\nD' = \\frac{D_n D_p [(n_0 + \\delta n) + (p_0 + \\delta n)]}{D_n (n_0 + \\delta n) + D_p (p_0 + \\delta n)}\n\\]\n(6.44)\n\nwhere \\( n_0 \\) and \\( p_0 \\) are the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, respectively, and \\( \\delta n \\) is the excess carrier concentration. If we consider a p-type semiconductor, we can assume that \\( p_0 \\gg n_0 \\). The condition of low-level injection, or just low injection, means that the excess carrier concentration is much smaller than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentration. For the p-type semiconductor, then, low injection implies that \\( \\delta n \\ll p_0 \\). Assuming that \\( n_0 \\ll p_0 \\) and \\( \\delta n \\ll p_0 \\), and assuming that \\( D_n \\) and \\( D_p \\) are on the same order of magnitude, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient from Equation (6.44) reduces to\n\n\\[\nD' = D_n\n\\]\n(6.45)\n\n\nIf we apply the conditions of an extrinsic p-type semiconductor and low injection to the ambipolar mobility, Equation (6.41) reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\mu' = \\mu_n\n\\]\n\n(6.46)\n\nIt is important to note that for an extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and the ambipolar mobility coefficient reduce to the minority carrier electron parameter values, which are constants. The ambipolar transport equation reduces to a linear differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nIf we now consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, we may assume that \\( p_0 \\ll n_0 \\) and \\( \\delta n \\ll n_0 \\). The ambipolar diffusion coefficient from Equation (6.43) reduces to\n\n\\[\nD' = D_p\n\\]\n\n(6.47)\n\nand the ambipolar mobility from Equation (6.41) reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\mu' = -\\mu_p\n\\]\n\n(6.48)\n\nThe ambipolar parameters again reduce to the minority-carrier values, which are constants. Note that, for the n-type semiconductor, the ambipolar mobility is a negative value. The ambipolar mobility term is associated with carrier drift; therefore, the sign of the drift term depends on the charge of the particle. The equivalent ambipolar particle is negatively charged, as one can see by comparing Equations (6.30) and (6.39). If the ambipolar mobility reduces to that of a positively charged hole, a negative sign is introduced as shown in Equation (6.48).\n\nThe remaining terms we need to consider in the ambipolar transport equation are the generation rate and the recombination rate. Recall that the electron and hole recombination rates are equal and are given by Equation (6.35) as \\( R_n = R_p = n/\\tau_n = p/\\tau_p = R \\), where \\( \\tau_n \\) and \\( \\tau_p \\) are the mean electron and hole lifetimes, respectively. If we consider the inverse lifetime functions, then \\( 1/\\tau_n \\) is the probability per unit time that an electron will encounter a hole and recombine. Likewise, \\( 1/\\tau_p \\) is the probability per unit time that a hole will encounter an electron and recombine. If we again consider an extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection, the concentration of majority carrier holes will be essentially constant, even when excess carriers are present. Then, the probability per unit time of a minority carrier electron encountering a majority carrier hole will be essentially constant. Hence, the minority carrier electron lifetime, \\( \\tau_n = \\tau_p \\), will remain a constant for the extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection.\n\nSimilarly, if we consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, the minority carrier hole lifetime, \\( \\tau_p = \\tau_n \\), will remain constant. Even under the condition of low injection, the minority carrier hole concentration may increase by several orders of magnitude. The probability per unit time of a minority carrier electron encountering a hole may change drastically. The majority carrier lifetime, then, may change substantially when excess carriers are present.\n\nConsider, again, the generation and recombination terms in the ambipolar transport equation. For electrons we may write\n\n\\[\ng - R = g_n - R_n = (G_{n0} + g'_n) - (R_{n0} + R'_n)\n\\]\n\n(6.49)\n\nwhere \\( G_{n0} \\) and \\( g'_n \\) are the thermal-equilibrium electron and excess electron generation rates, respectively. The terms \\( R_{n0} \\) and \\( R'_n \\) are the thermal-equilibrium electron and excess electron recombination rates, respectively. For thermal equilibrium, we have that\n\n\\[\nG_{n0} = R_{n0}\n\\]\n\n(6.50)\n\nso Equation (6.49) reduces to\n\n\\[\ng - R = g'_n - R'_n = g'_n - \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau_n}\n\\]\n\n(6.51)\n\nwhere \\( \\tau_n \\) is the excess minority carrier electron lifetime.\n\nFor the case of holes, we may write\n\n\\[\ng - R = g_p - R_p = (G_{p0} + g'_p) - (R_{p0} + R'_p)\n\\]\n\n(6.52)\n\nwhere \\( G_{p0} \\) and \\( g'_p \\) are the thermal-equilibrium hole and excess hole generation rates, respectively. The terms \\( R_{p0} \\) and \\( R'_p \\) are the thermal-equilibrium hole and excess hole recombination rates, respectively. Again, for thermal equilibrium, we have that\n\n\\[\nG_{p0} = R_{p0}\n\\]\n\n(6.53)\n\nso that Equation (6.52) reduces to\n\n\\[\ng - R = g'_p - R'_p = g'_p - \\frac{\\delta p}{\\tau_p}\n\\]\n\n(6.54)\n\nwhere \\( \\tau_p \\) is the excess minority carrier hole lifetime.\n\nThe generation rate for excess electrons must equal the generation rate for excess holes. We may then define a generation rate for excess carriers as \\( g' \\), so that \\( g'_n = g'_p = g' \\). We also determined that the minority carrier lifetime is essentially a constant for low injection. Then, the term \\( g - R \\) in the ambipolar transport equation may be written in terms of the minority carrier parameters.\n\nThe ambipolar transport equation, given by Equation (6.39), for a p-type semiconductor under low injection then becomes\n\n\\[\nD_n \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta n)}{\\partial x^2} - \\mu_n E \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial x} + g' - \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau_{n0}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(6.55)\n\nThe parameter \\( \\delta n \\) is the excess minority carrier electron concentration, the parameter \\( \\tau_{n0} \\) is the minority carrier lifetime under low injection, and the other parameters are the usual minority carrier electron parameters.\n\nSimilarly, for an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, the ambipolar transport equation becomes\n\n\\[\nD_p \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta p)}{\\partial x^2} - \\mu_p E \\frac{\\partial (\\delta p)}{\\partial x} + g' - \\frac{\\delta p}{\\tau_{p0}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta p)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(6.56)\n\nThe parameter \\( \\delta p \\) is the excess minority carrier hole concentration, the parameter \\( \\tau_{p0} \\) is the minority carrier hole lifetime under low injection, and the other parameters are the usual minority carrier hole parameters.\n\nIt is extremely important to note that the transport and recombination parameters in Equations (6.55) and (6.56) are those of the minority carrier. **Equations (6.55) and (6.56) describe the drift, diffusion, and recombination of excess minority carriers as a function of spatial coordinates and as a function of time.** Recall that we had imposed the condition of charge neutrality; the excess minority carrier concentration is equal to the excess majority carrier concentration. The excess majority carriers, then, diffuse and drift with the excess minority carriers; thus, the behavior of the excess majority carrier is determined by the minority carrier parameters. This ambipolar phenomenon is extremely important in semiconductor physics, and is the basis for describing the characteristics and behavior of semiconductor devices.\n\n### 6.3.3 Applications of the Ambipolar Transport Equation\n\nWe solve the ambipolar transport equation for several problems. These examples help illustrate the behavior of excess carriers in a semiconductor material, and the results are used later in the discussion of the pn junction and the other semiconductor devices.\n\nThe following examples use several common simplifications in the solution of the ambipolar transport equation. Table 6.2 summarizes these simplifications and their effects.\n\n\\[\n\\left[ \\frac{5 \\times 10^{10} \\times (1 - e^{-t/\\tau_{p0}})}{5 \\times 10^{16}} \\right] \\ll 1 \\quad \\text{(yes)}\n\\]\n\nThe excess minority carrier hole concentration increases with time with the same time constant \\( \\tau_{p0} \\), which is the excess minority carrier lifetime. The excess carrier concentration reaches a steady-state value as time goes to infinity, even though a steady-state generation of excess electrons and holes exists. This steady-state effect can be seen from Equation (6.60) by setting \\( d(\\delta p)/dt = 0 \\). The remaining terms simply state that, in steady state, the generation rate is equal to the recombination rate.\n\nAs before, we will assume charge neutrality; thus, the steady-state excess majority carrier hole concentration also decays exponentially with distance with the same characteristic minority carrier electron diffusion length \\(L_n\\). Figure 6.7 is a plot of the total electron and hole concentrations as a function of distance. We are assuming low injection, that is, \\(\\delta n(0) \\ll p_0\\) in the p-type semiconductor. The total concentration of majority carrier holes barely changes. However, we may have \\(\\delta n(0) \\gg n_0\\) and still satisfy the low-injection condition. The minority carrier concentration may change by many orders of magnitude.\n\n**Figure 6.7** Steady-state electron and hole concentrations for the case when excess electrons and holes are generated at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe three previous examples, which applied the ambipolar transport equation to specific situations, assumed either a homogeneous or a steady-state condition; only the time variation or the spatial variation was considered. Now consider an example in which both the time and spatial dependence are considered in the same problem.\n\nEquation (6.70) can be plotted as a function of distance \\( x \\), for various times. Figure 6.8 shows such a plot for the case when the applied electric field is zero. For \\( t > 0 \\), the excess minority carrier holes diffuse in both the \\( +x \\) and \\( -x \\) directions. During this time, the excess majority carrier electrons, which were generated, diffuse at exactly the same rate as the holes. As time proceeds, the excess holes recombine with the excess electrons so that at \\( t = \\infty \\) the excess hole concentration is zero. In this particular example, both diffusion and recombination processes are occurring at the same time.\n\nFigure 6.9 shows a plot of Equation (6.70) as a function of distance \\( x \\) at various times for the case when the applied electric field is not zero. In this case, the pulse of excess minority carrier holes is drifting in the \\( +x \\) direction, which is the direction of the electric field. We still have the same diffusion and recombination processes as we had before. An important point to consider is that, with charge neutrality, \\( \\delta n = \\delta p \\) at any instant of time and at any point in space. The excess electron concentration is equal to the excess hole concentration. In this case, then, the excess electron pulse is moving in the same direction as the applied electric field even though the electrons have a negative charge. In the ambipolar transport process, the excess carriers are characterized by the minority carrier parameters. In this example, the excess carriers behave according to the minority carrier hole parameters, which include \\( D_p, \\mu_p, \\) and \\( \\tau_p \\). The excess majority carrier electrons are being pulled along by the excess minority carrier holes.\n\n**Figure 6.8** Excess hole concentration versus distance at various times for zero applied electric field.\n\n- \\( \\delta p(x, t) \\)\n- \\( t = t_1 > 0 \\)\n- \\( t = t_2 > t_1 \\)\n- \\( t = t_3 > t_2 \\)\n- \\( E = 0 \\)\n- \\( x = 0 \\)\n- Distance, \\( x \\)\n\n**Figure 6.9** Excess hole concentration versus distance at various times for a constant applied electric field.\n\n- \\( \\delta p(x, t) \\)\n- \\( t = t_1 > 0 \\)\n- \\( t = t_2 > t_1 \\)\n- \\( t = t_3 > t_2 \\)\n- \\( E_0 \\)\n- \\( x = 0 \\)\n- Distance, \\( x \\)\n\n### 6.3.4 Dielectric Relaxation Time Constant\n\nWe have assumed in the previous analysis that a quasi-neutrality condition exists—that is, the concentration of excess holes is balanced by an equal concentration of excess electrons. Suppose that we have a situation as shown in Figure 6.10, in which a uniform concentration of holes \\( \\delta p \\) is suddenly injected into a portion of the surface of a semiconductor. We will instantly have a concentration of excess holes and a net positive charge density that is not balanced by a concentration of excess electrons. How is charge neutrality achieved and how fast?\n\nThere are three defining equations to be considered. Poisson’s equation is\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon} \\tag{6.71}\n\\]\n\nThe current equation, Ohm’s law, is\n\n\\[\nJ = \\sigma E \\tag{6.72}\n\\]\n\nThe continuity equation, neglecting the effects of generation and recombination, is\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot J = -\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} \\tag{6.73}\n\\]\n\n**Figure 6.10** | The injection of a concentration of holes into a small region at the surface of an n-type semiconductor.\n\nThe parameter \\( \\rho \\) is the net charge density and the initial value is given by \\( e\\delta p \\). We will assume that \\( \\delta p \\) is uniform over a short distance at the surface. The parameter \\( \\epsilon \\) is the permittivity of the semiconductor.\n\nTaking the divergence of Ohm’s law and using Poisson’s equation, we find\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\sigma \\rho}{\\epsilon}\n\\tag{6.74}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting Equation (6.74) into the continuity equation, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma \\rho}{\\epsilon} = -\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{d \\rho}{dt}\n\\tag{6.75}\n\\]\n\nSince Equation (6.75) is a function of time only, we can write the equation as a total derivative. Equation (6.75) can be rearranged as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\rho}{dt} + \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} \\right) \\rho = 0\n\\tag{6.76}\n\\]\n\nEquation (6.76) is a first-order differential equation whose solution is\n\n\\[\n\\rho(t) = \\rho(0)e^{-t/\\tau_d}\n\\tag{6.77}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\tau_d = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma}\n\\tag{6.78}\n\\]\n\nand is called the dielectric relaxation time constant.\n\n### *6.3.5 Haynes–Shockley Experiment\n\nWe have derived the mathematics describing the behavior of excess carriers in a semiconductor. The Haynes–Shockley experiment was one of the first experiments to actually measure excess carrier behavior.\n\nFigure 6.11 shows the basic experimental arrangement. The voltage source \\( V_1 \\) establishes an applied electric field \\( E_0 \\) in the \\( +x \\) direction in the n-type semiconductor sample. Excess carriers are effectively injected into the semiconductor at contact A. Contact B is a rectifying contact that is under reverse bias by the voltage source \\( V_2 \\). The contact B will collect a fraction of the excess carriers as they drift through the semiconductor. The collected carriers will generate an output voltage, \\( V_0 \\).\n\nThis experiment corresponds to the problem we discussed in Example 6.5. Figure 6.12 shows the excess carrier concentrations at contacts A and B for two conditions. Figure 6.12a shows the idealized excess carrier pulse at contact A at time \\( t = 0 \\). For a given electric field \\( E_0 \\), the excess carriers will drift along the\n\n\n**Figure 6.11** The basic Haynes–Shockley experimental arrangement.\n\n\n**Figure 6.12** (a) The idealized excess carrier pulse at terminal A at \\( t = 0 \\). (b) The excess carrier pulse versus time at terminal B for a given applied electric field. (c) The excess carrier pulse versus time at terminal B for a smaller applied electric field.\n\n\nThe semiconductor producing an output voltage as a function of time is given in Figure 6.12b. The peak of the pulse will arrive at contact B at time \\( t_0 \\). If the applied electric field is reduced to a value \\( E_{02}, \\, E_{02} < E_{01} \\), the output voltage response at contact B will look approximately as shown in Figure 6.12c. For the smaller electric field, the drift velocity of the pulse of excess carriers is smaller, and so it will take a longer time for the pulse to reach the contact B. During this longer time period, there is more diffusion and more recombination. The excess carrier pulse shapes shown in Figure 6.12b, c are different for the two electric field conditions.\n\nThe minority carrier mobility, lifetime, and diffusion coefficient can be determined from this single experiment. As a good first approximation, the peak of the minority carrier pulse will arrive at contact B when the experiment involving distance and time in Equation (6.70) is zero, or\n\n\\[\nx - \\mu_n E_0 t = 0\n\\]\n\n(6.79a)\n\nIn this case \\( x = d \\), where \\( d \\) is the distance between contacts A and B, and \\( t = t_0 \\), where \\( t_0 \\) is the time at which the peak of the pulse reaches contact B. The mobility may be calculated as\n\n\\[\n\\mu_n = \\frac{d}{E_0 t_0}\n\\]\n\n(6.79b)\n\nFigure 6.13 again shows the output response as a function of time. At times \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_2 \\), the magnitude of the excess concentration is \\( e^{-1} \\) of its peak value. If the time difference between \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_2 \\) is not too large, \\( e^{-t/\\tau_p} \\) and \\( (4\\pi D_p t)^{1/2} \\) do not change appreciably during this time; then the equation\n\n\\[\n(d - \\mu_n E_0 t) = 4D_p t\n\\]\n\n(6.80)\n\nis satisfied at both \\( t = t_1 \\) and \\( t = t_2 \\). If we set \\( t = t_1 \\) and \\( t = t_2 \\) in Equation (6.80) and add the two resulting equations, we may show that the diffusion coefficient is given by\n\n\\[\nD_p = \\frac{(\\mu_n E_0)^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{16 t_0}\n\\]\n\n(6.81)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1\n\\]\n\n(6.82)\n\nThe area \\( S \\) under the curve shown in Figure 6.13 is proportional to the number of excess holes that have not recombined with majority carrier electrons. We may write\n\n\\[\nS = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_0}{\\tau_p}\\right) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\mu_n E_0 \\tau_p}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(6.83)\n\nwhere \\( K \\) is a constant. By varying the electric field, the area under the curve will change. A plot of \\(\\ln(S)\\) as a function of \\((d/\\mu_n E_0)\\) will yield a straight line whose slope is \\((1/\\tau_p)\\), so the minority carrier lifetime can also be determined from this experiment.\n\n\n**Figure 6.13** | The output excess carrier pulse versus time to determine the diffusion coefficient.",

    "text": "## 6.4 Quasi-Fermi Energy Levels\n\nThe Haynes–Shockley experiment is elegant in the sense that the three basic processes of drift, diffusion, and recombination are all observed in a single experiment. The determination of mobility is straightforward and can yield accurate values. The determination of the diffusion coefficient and lifetime is more complicated and may lead to some inaccuracies.\n\n### 6.4.1 Quasi-Fermi Energy Levels\n\nThe thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are functions of the Fermi energy level. We can write\n\n\\[\nn_0 = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_F - E_{Fi}}{kT} \\right) \\tag{6.84a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\np_0 = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_{Fi} - E_F}{kT} \\right) \\tag{6.84b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( E_F \\) and \\( E_{Fi} \\) are the Fermi energy and intrinsic Fermi energy, respectively, and \\( n_i \\) is the intrinsic carrier concentration. Figure 6.14a shows the energy-band diagram for an n-type semiconductor in which \\( E_F > E_{Fi} \\). For this case, we may note from Equations (6.84a) and (6.84b) that \\( n_0 > n_i \\) and \\( p_0 < n_i \\), as we would expect. Similarly, Figure 6.14b shows the energy-band diagram for a p-type semiconductor in which \\( E_F < E_{Fi} \\). Again we may note from Equations (6.84a) and (6.84b) that \\( n_0 < n_i \\) and \\( p_0 > n_i \\), as we would expect for the p-type material. These results are for thermal equilibrium.\n\nIf excess carriers are created in a semiconductor, we are no longer in thermal equilibrium and the Fermi energy is strictly no longer defined. However, we may define a quasi-Fermi level for electrons and a quasi-Fermi level for holes that apply for nonequilibrium. If \\( \\delta n \\) and \\( \\delta p \\) are the excess electron and hole concentrations, respectively, we may write\n\n\\[\nn_0 + \\delta n = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_n - E_{Fi}}{kT} \\right) \\tag{6.85a}\n\\]\n\n\n**Figure 6.14** | Thermal-equilibrium energy-band diagrams for (a) n-type semiconductor and (b) p-type semiconductor.\n\n\nand\n\n\\[\np_0 + \\delta p = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_{Fi} - E_{Fp}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(6.85b)\n\nwhere \\(E_{Fn}\\) and \\(E_{Fp}\\) are the quasi-Fermi energy levels for electrons and holes, respectively. The total electron concentration and the total hole concentration are functions of the quasi-Fermi levels.\n\nFigure 6.15a shows the energy-band diagram with the Fermi energy level corresponding to thermal equilibrium. Figure 6.15b now shows the energy-band diagram under the nonequilibrium condition. Since the majority carrier electron concentration does not change significantly for this low-injection condition, the quasi-Fermi level for electrons is not much different from the thermal-equilibrium Fermi level.\n\n**Figure 6.15** (a) Thermal-equilibrium energy-band diagram for \\( N_A = 10^5 \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\) and \\( n_i = 10^{10} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\).

Since the electron concentration has increased, the quasi-Fermi level for electrons has moved slightly closer to the conduction band. The hole concentration has increased significantly so that the quasi-Fermi level for holes has moved much closer to the valence band.

    "text": "## 6.5 EXCESS CARRIER LIFETIME\n\nThe rate at which excess electrons and holes recombine is an important characteristic of the semiconductor and influences many of the device characteristics, as we will see in later chapters. We considered recombination briefly at the beginning of this chapter and argued that the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the mean carrier lifetime. We have assumed up to this point that the mean carrier lifetime is simply a parameter of the semiconductor material.\n\nWe have been considering an ideal semiconductor in which electronic energy states do not exist within the forbidden-energy bandgap. This ideal effect is present in a perfect single-crystal material with an ideal periodic-potential function. In a real semiconductor material, defects occur within the crystal and disrupt the perfect periodic-potential function. If the density of these defects is not too great, the defects will create discrete electronic energy states within the forbidden-energy band. These allowed energy states may be the dominant effect in determining the mean carrier lifetime. The mean carrier lifetime may be determined from the Shockley–Read–Hall theory of recombination.\n\n### 6.5.1 Shockley–Read–Hall Theory of Recombination\n\nAn allowed energy state, also called a trap, within the forbidden bandgap may act as a recombination center, capturing both electrons and holes with almost equal probability. This equal probability of capture means that the capture cross sections for\n\n**Figure 6.16** | The four basic trapping and emission processes for the case of an acceptor-type trap.\n\n- **Process 1**: Electron capture\n- **Process 2**: Electron emission\n- **Process 3**: Hole capture\n- **Process 4**: Hole emission\n\nThe Shockley–Read–Hall theory of recombination assumes that a single recombination center, or trap, exists at an energy \\( E_t \\) within the bandgap. There are four basic processes, shown in Figure 6.16, that may occur at this single trap. We will assume that the trap is an acceptor-type trap; that is, it is negatively charged when it contains an electron and is neutral when it does not contain an electron.\n\nThe four basic processes are as follows:\n\n- **Process 1**: The capture of an electron from the conduction band by an initially neutral empty trap.\n- **Process 2**: The inverse of process 1—the emission of an electron that is initially occupying a trap level back into the conduction band.\n- **Process 3**: The capture of a hole from the valence band by a trap containing an electron. (Or we may consider the process to be the emission of an electron from the trap into the valence band.)\n- **Process 4**: The inverse of process 3—the emission of a hole from a neutral trap into the valence band. (Or we may consider this process to be the capture of an electron from the valence band.)\n\nIn process 1, the rate at which electrons from the conduction band are captured by the traps is proportional to the density of electrons in the conduction band and...\n\nproportional to the density of empty trap states. We can then write the electron capture rate as\n\n\\[\nR_{cn} = C_n N_t [1 - f_t(E_t)] n\n\\]\n\n(6.86)\n\nwhere\n\n- \\( R_{cn} \\) = capture rate (#/cm\\(^3\\)·s)\n- \\( C_n \\) = constant proportional to electron-capture cross section\n- \\( N_t \\) = total concentration of trapping centers\n- \\( n \\) = electron concentration in the conduction band\n- \\( f_t(E_t) \\) = Fermi function at the trap energy\n\nThe Fermi function at the trap energy is given by\n\n\\[\nf_t(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_t - E_f}{kT}\\right)}\n\\]\n\n(6.87)\n\nwhich is the probability that a trap will contain an electron. The function \\([1 - f_t(E_t)]\\) is the probability that the trap is empty. In Equation (6.87), we have assumed that the degeneracy factor is 1, which is the usual approximation made in this analysis. However, if a degeneracy factor is included, it will eventually be absorbed in other constants later in the analysis.\n\nFor process 2, the rate at which electrons are emitted from filled traps back into the conduction band is proportional to the number of filled traps, so that\n\n\\[\nR_{en} = E_n N_t f_t(E_t)\n\\]\n\n(6.88)\n\nwhere\n\n- \\( R_{en} \\) = emission rate (#/cm\\(^3\\)·s)\n- \\( E_n \\) = constant\n- \\( f_t(E_t) \\) = probability that the trap is occupied\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, the rate of electron capture from the conduction band and the rate of electron emission back into the conduction band must be equal. Then\n\n\\[\nR_{cn} = R_{en}\n\\]\n\n(6.89)\n\nso that\n\n\\[\nE_n N_t f_t(E_t) = C_n N_t [1 - f_{t0}(E_t)] n_0\n\\]\n\n(6.90)\n\nwhere \\( f_{t0} \\) denotes the thermal-equilibrium Fermi function. Note that, in thermal equilibrium, the value of the electron concentration in the capture rate term is the equilibrium value \\( n_0 \\). Using the Boltzmann approximation for the Fermi function, we can find \\( E_n \\) in terms of \\( C_n \\) as\n\n\\[\nE_n = n' C_n\n\\]\n\n(6.91)\n\nwhere \\( n' \\) is defined as\n\n\\[\nn' = N_c \\exp \\left[ \\frac{-(E_c - E_t)}{kT} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(6.92)\n\nThe parameter \\( n' \\) is equivalent to an electron concentration that would exist in the conduction band if the trap energy \\( E_t \\) coincided with the Fermi energy \\( E_f \\).\n\nIn nonequilibrium, excess electrons exist, so that the net rate at which electrons are captured from the conduction band is given by\n\n\\[\nR_n = R_{cn} - R_{en}\n\\]\n\n(6.93)\n\nwhich is just the difference between the capture rate and the emission rate. Combining Equations (6.86) and (6.88) with (6.93) gives\n\n\\[\nR_n = [C_n N_c (1 - f_r(E_t)) n] - [E_n N_t f_r(E_t)]\n\\]\n\n(6.94)\n\nWe may note that, in this equation, the electron concentration \\( n \\) is the total concentration, which includes the excess electron concentration. The remaining constants and terms in Equation (6.94) are the same as defined previously and the Fermi energy in the Fermi probability function needs to be replaced by the quasi-Fermi energy for electrons. The constants \\( E_n \\) and \\( C_n \\) are related by Equation (6.91), so the net recombination rate can be written as\n\n\\[\nR_n = C_n N_t [n(1 - f_r(E_t)) - n'f_r(E_t)]\n\\]\n\n(6.95)\n\nIf we consider processes 3 and 4 in the recombination theory, the net rate at which holes are captured from the valence band is given by\n\n\\[\nR_p = C_p N_v [pf_r(E_t) - p'(1 - f_r(E_t))]\n\\]\n\n(6.96)\n\nwhere \\( C_p \\) is a constant proportional to the hole capture rate, and \\( p' \\) is given by\n\n\\[\np' = N_v \\exp \\left[ \\frac{-(E_t - E_v)}{kT} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(6.97)\n\nIn a semiconductor in which the trap density is not too large, the excess electron and hole concentrations are equal and the recombination rates of electrons and holes are equal. If we set Equation (6.95) equal to Equation (6.96) and solve for the Fermi function, we obtain\n\n\\[\nf_r(E_t) = \\frac{C_n n + C_p p'}{C_n(n + n') + C_p(p + p')}\n\\]\n\n(6.98)\n\nWe may note that \\( n' p' = n_i^2 \\). Then, substituting Equation (6.98) back into either Equation (6.95) or (6.96) gives\n\n\\[\nR_n = R_p = \\frac{C_n C_p N_t (np - n_i^2)}{C_n(n + n') + C_p(p + p')} = R\n\\]\n\n(6.99)\n\nEquation (6.99) is the recombination rate of electrons and holes due to the recombination center at \\( E = E_t \\). If we consider thermal equilibrium, then \\( np = n_0 p_0 = n_i^2 \\), so that \\( R_n = R_p = 0 \\). Equation (6.99), then, is the recombination rate of excess electrons and holes.\n\nSince \\( R \\) in Equation (6.99) is the recombination rate of the excess carriers, we may write\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau}\n\\]\n\n(6.100)\n\nwhere \\(\\delta n\\) is the excess carrier concentration and \\(\\tau\\) is the lifetime of the excess carriers.\n\n### 6.5.2 Limits of Extrinsic Doping and Low Injection\n\nWe simplified the ambipolar transport equation, Equation (6.39), from a nonlinear differential equation to a linear differential equation by applying limits of extrinsic doping and low injection. We may apply these same limits to the recombination rate equation.\n\nConsider an n-type semiconductor under low injection. Then\n\n\\[\nn_0 \\gg p_0, \\quad n_0 \\gg \\delta p, \\quad n_0 \\gg n', \\quad n_0 \\gg p'\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\delta p\\) is the excess minority carrier hole concentration. The assumptions of \\(n_0 \\gg n'\\) and \\(n_0 \\gg p'\\) imply that the trap level energy is near midgap so that \\(n'\\) and \\(p'\\) are not too different from the intrinsic carrier concentration. With these assumptions, Equation (6.99) reduces to\n\n\\[\nR = C_n N_i \\delta p\n\\]\n\n(6.101)\n\nThe recombination rate of excess carriers in the n-type semiconductor is a function of the parameter \\(C_n\\), which is related to the minority carrier hole capture cross section. The recombination rate, then, is a function of the minority carrier parameter in the same way that the ambipolar transport parameters reduced to their minority carrier values.\n\nThe recombination rate is related to the mean carrier lifetime. Comparing Equations (6.100) and (6.101), we may write\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau} = C_n N_i \\delta p = \\frac{\\delta p}{\\tau_{p0}}\n\\]\n\n(6.102)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{p0} = \\frac{1}{C_n N_i}\n\\]\n\n(6.103)\n\nand where \\(\\tau_{p0}\\) is defined as the excess minority carrier hole lifetime. If the trap concentration increases, the probability of excess carrier recombination increases; thus, the excess minority carrier lifetime decreases.\n\nSimilarly, if we have a strongly extrinsic p-type material under low injection, we can assume that\n\n\\[\np_0 \\gg n_0, \\quad p_0 \\gg \\delta n, \\quad p_0 \\gg n', \\quad p_0 \\gg p'\n\\]\n\nThe lifetime then becomes that of the excess minority carrier electron lifetime, or\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{n0} = \\frac{1}{C_n N_t}\n\\]\n\n(6.104)\n\nAgain note that for the n-type material, the lifetime is a function of \\(C_p\\), which is related to the capture rate of the minority carrier hole. And for the p-type material, the lifetime is a function of \\(C_n\\), which is related to the capture rate of the minority carrier electron. The excess carrier lifetime for an extrinsic material under low injection reduces to that of the minority carrier.\n\nIntuitively, we can see that the number of majority carriers that are available for recombining with excess minority carriers decreases as the extrinsic semiconductor becomes intrinsic. Since there are fewer carriers available for recombining in the intrinsic material, the mean lifetime of an excess carrier increases.",

    "text": "## 6.6 Surface Effects\n\n### 6.6.1 Surface States\n\nIn all previous discussions, we have implicitly assumed the semiconductors were infinite in extent; thus, we were not concerned with any boundary conditions at a semiconductor surface. In any real application of semiconductors, the material is not infinitely large and therefore surfaces do exist between the semiconductor and an adjacent medium.\n\nWhen a semiconductor is abruptly terminated, the perfect periodic nature of the idealized single-crystal lattice ends abruptly at the surface. The disruption of the periodic-potential function results in allowed electronic energy states within the energy bandgap. In the previous section, we argued that simple defects in the semiconductor would create discrete energy states within the bandgap. The abrupt termination of the periodic potential at the surface results in a distribution of allowed energy states within the bandgap, shown schematically in Figure 6.17 along with the discrete energy states in the bulk semiconductor.\n\nThe Shockley–Read–Hall recombination theory shows that the excess minority carrier lifetime is inversely proportional to the density of trap states. We may argue that since the density of traps at the surface is larger than in the bulk, the excess minority carrier lifetime at the surface will be smaller than the corresponding lifetime in the bulk material. If we consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor, for example, the recombination rate of excess carriers in the bulk, given by Equation (6.102), is\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{\\delta p}{\\tau_{p0}} = \\frac{\\delta p_B}{\\tau_{p0}}\n\\]\n\n(6.106)\n\nwhere \\(\\delta p_B\\) is the concentration of excess minority carrier holes in the bulk material. We may write a similar expression for the recombination rate of excess carriers at the surface as\n\n\\[\nR_s = \\frac{\\delta p_s}{\\tau_{ps}}\n\\]\n\n(6.107)\n\nwhere \\(\\delta p_s\\) is the excess minority carrier hole concentration at the surface and \\(\\tau_{ps}\\) is the excess minority carrier hole lifetime at the surface.\n\n**Figure 6.17** | Distribution of surface states within the forbidden bandgap.\n\n**Figure 6.18** | Steady-state excess hole concentration versus distance from a semiconductor surface.\n\nAssume that excess carriers are being generated at a constant rate throughout the entire semiconductor material. We showed that, in steady state, the generation rate is equal to the recombination rate for the case of a homogeneous, infinite semiconductor. Using this argument, the recombination rates at the surface and in the bulk material must be equal. Since \\(\\tau_{p0} < \\tau_{pb}\\), then the excess minority carrier concentration at the surface is smaller than the excess minority carrier concentration in the bulk region, or \\(\\delta p_s < \\delta p_b\\). Figure 6.18 shows an example of the excess carrier concentration.\n\n### 6.6.2 Surface Recombination Velocity\n\nA gradient in the excess carrier concentration exists near the surface as shown in Figure 6.18; excess carriers from the bulk region diffuse toward the surface where they recombine. This diffusion toward the surface can be described by\n\n\\[\n-D_p \\left[ \\hat{n} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{d \\delta p}{d x} \\right) \\right]_{\\text{surf}} = s \\delta p_{\\text{surf}}\n\\]\n\n(6.110)\n\nwhere each side of the equation is evaluated at the surface. The parameter \\(\\hat{n}\\) is the unit outward vector normal to the surface. Using the geometry of Figure 6.18, \\(d(\\delta p)/dx\\) is a positive quantity and \\(\\hat{n}\\) is negative, so that the parameter \\(s\\) is a positive quantity.\n\nA dimensional analysis of Equation (6.110) shows that the parameter \\(s\\) has units of cm/s, or velocity. The parameter \\(s\\) is called the **surface recombination velocity**. If the excess concentrations at the surface and in the bulk region were equal, then the gradient term would be zero and the surface recombination velocity would be zero. As the excess concentration at the surface becomes smaller, the gradient term becomes larger, and the surface recombination velocity increases. The surface recombination velocity gives some indication of the surface characteristics as compared with the bulk region.\n\nEquation (6.110) may be used as a boundary condition to the general solution given by Equation (6.109) in Example 6.8. Using Figure 6.18, we have that at \\( \\bar{t} = -1 \\), and Equation (6.110) becomes\n\n\\[\nD_p \\frac{d(\\delta p)}{dx} \\bigg|_{\\text{surf}} = s \\delta p|_{\\text{surf}}\n\\]\n\n(6.111)\n\nWe have argued that the coefficient \\( A \\) is zero in Equation (6.109). Then, from Equation (6.109), we can write that\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_{\\text{surf}} = \\delta p(0) = g' \\tau_{p0} + B\n\\]\n\n(6.112a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d(\\delta p)}{dx} \\bigg|_{\\text{surf}} = \\frac{d(\\delta p)}{dx} \\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{B}{L_p}\n\\]\n\n(6.112b)\n\nSubstituting Equations (6.112a) and (6.112b) into Equation (6.111) and solving for the coefficient \\( B \\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nB = -\\frac{s g' \\tau_{p0}}{(D_p/L_p) + s}\n\\]\n\n(6.113)\n\nThe excess minority carrier hole concentration can then be written as\n\n\\[\n\\delta p(x) = g' \\tau_{p0} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{s L_p e^{-x/L_p}}{D_p + s L_p} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(6.114)\n\n[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{(i)} & \\quad \\delta p(x) \\approx \\delta p(0) \\left( q \\right) \\cdot s_{0,L} = \\left( x \\delta q \\right) \\cdot \\left( q \\right) \\cdot s_{0,L} = \\left( x \\delta q \\right) \\cdot \\left( q \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\tau_{n,p} - 1 \\right) \\cdot s_{0,L} = \\left( x \\delta q \\right) \\cdot \\left( q \\right) \\cdot \\text{usv} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn the above example, the surface influences the excess carrier concentration to the extent that, even at a distance of \\( L_p = 31.6 \\, \\mu \\text{m} \\) from the surface, the excess carrier concentration is only two-thirds of the value in the bulk. We will see in later chapters that device performance is dependent in large part on the properties of excess carriers.",

    "text": "## 13.1 JFET CONCEPTS\n\nThe concept of the field-effect phenomenon was the basis for the first proposed solid-state transistor. Patents filed in the 1920s and 1930s conceived and investigated the transistor shown in Figure 13.1. A voltage applied to the metal plate modulated the conductance of the semiconductor under the metal and controlled the current between the ohmic contacts. Good semiconductor materials and processing technology were not available at that time, so the device was not seriously considered again until the 1950s.\n\nThe phenomenon of modulating the conductance of a semiconductor by an electric field applied perpendicular to the surface of a semiconductor is called field effect. This type of transistor has also been called the unipolar transistor, to emphasize that only one type of carrier, the majority carrier, is involved in the operation. We will qualitatively discuss the basic operation of the two types of JFETs in this section, and introduce some of the JFET terminology.\n\n### 13.1.1 Basic pn JFET Operation\n\nThe first type of field-effect transistor is the pn junction field-effect transistor, or pn JFET. A simplified cross section of a symmetrical device is shown in Figure 13.2. The n region between the two p regions is known as the channel and, in this n-channel\n\n*Figure 13.1 | Idealization of the Lilienfeld transistor. (From Pierret [10].)*\n\n*Figure 13.2 | Cross section of a symmetrical n-channel pn junction FET.*\n\nDevice, majority carrier electrons flow between the source and drain terminals. The source is the terminal from which carriers enter the channel from the external circuit, the drain is the terminal where carriers leave, or are drained from, the device, and the gate is the control terminal. The two gate terminals shown in Figure 13.2 are tied together to form a single gate connection. Since majority carrier electrons are primarily involved in the conduction in this n-channel transistor, the JFET is a majority-carrier device.\n\nA complementary p-channel JFET can also be fabricated in which the p and n regions are reversed from those of the n-channel device. Holes will flow in the p-type channel between source and drain and the source terminal will now be the source of the holes. The current direction and voltage polarities in the p-channel JFET are the reverse of those in the n-channel device. The p-channel JFET is generally a lower frequency device than the n-channel JFET due to the lower hole mobility.\n\nFigure 13.3a shows an n-channel pn JFET with zero volts applied to the gate. If the source is at ground potential, and if a small positive drain voltage is applied, a drain current \\( I_D \\) is produced between the source and drain terminals. The n channel is essentially a resistance so the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) characteristic, for small \\( V_{DS} \\) values, is approximately linear, as shown in the figure.\n\nWhen we apply a voltage to the gate of a pn JFET with respect to the source and drain, we alter the channel conductance. If a negative voltage is applied to the gate of the n-channel pn JFET shown in Figure 13.3, the gate-to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased. The space charge region now widens so the channel region becomes narrower and the resistance of the n channel increases. The slope of the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve, for small \\( V_{DS} \\), decreases. These effects are shown in Figure 13.3b. If a larger negative gate voltage is applied, the condition shown in Figure 13.3c can be achieved. The reverse-biased gate-to-channel space charge region has completely filled the channel region. This condition is known as **pinch-off**. The drain current at pinch-off is essentially zero, since the depletion region isolates the source and drain terminals. Figure 13.3c shows the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) curve for this case, as well as the other two cases.\n\nThe current in the channel is controlled by the gate voltage. The control of the current in one part of the device by a voltage in another part of the device is the basic transistor action. This device is a normally on or **depletion mode** device, which means that a voltage must be applied to the gate terminal to turn the device off.\n\nNow consider the situation in which the gate voltage is held at zero volts, \\( V_{GS} = 0 \\), and the drain voltage changes. Figure 13.4a is a replica of Figure 13.3a for zero gate voltage and a small drain voltage. As the drain voltage increases (positive), the gate-to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased near the drain terminal so that the space charge region extends further into the channel. The channel is essentially a resistor, and the effective channel resistance increases as the space charge region widens; therefore, the slope of the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) characteristic decreases as shown in Figure 13.4b. The effective channel resistance now varies along the channel length and, since the channel current must be constant, the voltage drop through the channel becomes dependent on position.\n\n- **(a)** \\( V_{GS} = 0 \\)\n\n  !Diagram (a)\n\n  !Graph (a)\n\n- **(b)** \\( V_{GS} = -V_1 \\)\n\n  !Diagram (b)\n\n  !Graph (b)\n\n- **(c)** \\( V_{GS} = -V_2 \\)\n\n**Figure 13.3.1** Gate-to-channel space charge regions and \\( I-V \\) characteristics for small \\( V_{DS} \\) values and for (a) zero gate voltage, (b) small reverse-biased gate voltage, and (c) a gate voltage to achieve pinchoff.\n\nIf the drain voltage increases further, the condition shown in Figure 13.4c can result. The channel has been pinched off at the drain terminal. Any further increase in drain voltage will not cause an increase in drain current. The \\( I-V \\) characteristic for this condition is also shown in this figure. The drain voltage at pinchoff is referred to as \\( V_{DS}(sat) \\). For \\( V_{DS} > V_{DS}(sat) \\), the transistor is said to be in the saturation region and the drain current, for this ideal case, is independent of \\( V_{DS} \\). At first glance, we might expect the drain current to go to zero when the channel becomes pinched off at the drain terminal, but we will show why this does not happen.\n\n**Figure 13.4** Gate-to-channel space charge regions and \\( I \\)–\\( V \\) characteristics for zero gate voltage and for (a) a small drain voltage, (b) a larger drain voltage, and (c) a drain voltage to achieve pinchoff at the drain terminal.\n\nFigure 13.5 shows an expanded view of the pinchoff region in the channel. The n channel and drain terminal are now separated by a space charge region which has a length \\(\\Delta L\\). The electrons move through the n channel from the source and are injected into the space charge region where, subjected to the E-field force, they are swept through into the drain contact area. If we assume that \\(\\Delta L \\ll L\\), then the electric field in the n-channel region remains unchanged from the \\(V_{DS}(sat)\\) case; the drain current will remain constant as \\(V_{DS}\\) changes. Once the carriers are in the drain region, the current remains constant.\n\n#### Basic MESFET Operation\n\nThe second type of junction field-effect transistor is the MESFET. The gate junction in the pn junction FET is replaced by a Schottky barrier rectifying contact. Although MESFETs can be fabricated in silicon, they are usually associated with gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor materials. A simplified cross section of a GaAs MESFET is shown in Figure 13.6. A thin epitaxial layer of GaAs is used for the active region; the substrate is a very high resistivity GaAs material referred to as a semi-insulating substrate. GaAs is intentionally doped with chromium, which behaves as a single acceptor close to the center of the energy bandgap, to make it semi-insulating with a resistivity as high as \\(10^9 \\, \\Omega \\cdot \\text{cm}\\). The advantages of these devices include higher electron mobility, hence smaller transit time and faster response; and decreased parasitic capacitance and a simplified fabrication process, resulting from the semi-insulating GaAs substrate.\n\nIn the MESFET shown in Figure 13.6, a reverse-biased gate-to-source voltage induces a space charge region under the metal gate that modulates the channel conductance as in the case of the pn JFET. The space charge region will eventually reach the substrate if the applied negative gate voltage is sufficiently large. This condition, again, is known as pinch-off. The device shown in this figure is also a depletion mode device, since a gate voltage must be applied to pinch off the channel.\n\nIf we treat the semi-insulating substrate as an intrinsic material, then the energy-band diagram of the substrate–channel–metal structure is as shown in Figure 13.7 for the case of zero bias applied to the gate. Because there is a potential barrier between the channel and substrate and between the channel and metal, the majority carrier electrons are confined to the channel region.\n\nConsider, now, another type of MESFET in which the channel is pinched off even at \\(V_{GS} = 0\\). Figure 13.8a shows this condition, in which the channel thickness is smaller than the zero-biased space charge width. To open a channel, the depletion region must be reduced: A forward-bias voltage must be applied to the gate–semiconductor.\n\n- **Figure 13.5**: Expanded view of the space charge region in the channel for \\(V_{DS} > V_{DS(sat)}\\).\n\n- **Figure 13.6**: Cross section of an n-channel MESFET with a semi-insulating substrate.\n\n- The drain current will be independent of \\(V_{DS}\\); thus, the device looks like a constant current source.\n\n**Figure 13.7** | Idealized energy-band diagram of the substrate–channel–metal in the n-channel MESFET.\n\n**Figure 13.8** | Channel space charge region of an enhancement mode MESFET for (a) \\( V_{GS} = 0 \\), (b) \\( V_{GS} = V_T \\), and (c) \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\).\n\n- **(a)** \\( V_{GS} = 0 \\)\n- **(b)** \\( V_{GS} = V_T \\)\n- **(c)** \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\)\n\n\nWhen a slightly forward-bias voltage is applied, the depletion region just extends through the channel—a condition known as **threshold**, shown in Figure 13.8b. The threshold voltage is the gate-to-source voltage that must be applied to create the pinch-off condition. The threshold voltage for this n-channel MESFET is positive, in contrast to the negative voltage for the n-channel depletion mode device. If a larger forward bias is applied, the channel region opens as shown in Figure 13.8c.\n\napplied forward-bias gate voltage is limited to a few tenths of a volt before there is significant gate current. This device is known as an n-channel enhancement mode MESFET. Enhancement mode p-channel MESFETs and enhancement mode pn junction FETs have also been fabricated. The advantage of enhancement mode MESFETs is that circuits can be designed in which the voltage polarity on the gate and drain is the same. However, the output voltage swing will be quite small with these devices.",

    "text": "## 13.2 THE DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nTo describe the basic electrical characteristics of the JFET, we initially consider a uniformly doped depletion mode pn JFET and then later discuss the enhancement mode device. The pinchoff voltage and drain-to-source saturation voltage are defined and expressions for these parameters derived in terms of geometry and electrical properties. The ideal current–voltage relationship is developed, and then the transconductance, or transistor gain is determined.\n\nFigure 13.9a shows a symmetrical, two-sided pn JFET and Figure 13.9b shows a MESFET with the semi-insulating substrate. One can derive the ideal DC current–voltage relationship for both devices by simply considering the two-sided device to be two JFETs in parallel. We derive the I–V characteristics in terms of \\(I_{D1}\\) so that the drain current in the two-sided device becomes \\(I_{D2} = 2I_{D1}\\). We ignore any depletion region at the substrate of the one-sided device in the ideal case.\n\n### 13.2.1 Internal Pinchoff Voltage, Pinchoff Voltage, and Drain-to-Source Saturation Voltage\n\n**n-channel pn JFET** Figure 13.10a shows a simplified one-sided n-channel pn JFET. The metallurgical channel thickness between the p\\(^+\\) gate region and the substrate is \\(a\\), and the induced depletion region width for the one-sided p\\(^+\\)n junction is \\(h\\). Assume the drain-to-source voltage is zero. If we assume the abrupt depletion approximation, then the space charge width is given by\n\n\\[\nh = \\left[\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s(V_{bi} - V_{GS})}{eN_d}\\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(13.1)\n\nwhere \\(V_{GS}\\) is the gate-to-source voltage and \\(V_{bi}\\) is the built-in potential barrier. For a reverse-biased p\\(^+\\)n junction, \\(V_{GS}\\) must be a negative voltage.\n\n\n**Figure 13.9** | Drain currents of (a) a symmetrical, two-sided pn JFET, and (b) a one-sided MESFET.\n\n**Figure 13.10** | Geometries of simplified (a) n-channel and (b) p-channel pn JFETs.\n\nAt pinchoff, \\( h = a \\) and the total potential across the p*n junction is called the **internal pinchoff voltage**, denoted by \\( V_{po} \\). We now have\n\n\\[\na = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s V_{po}}{e N_d} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(13.2)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nV_{po} = \\frac{ea^2 N_d}{2 \\varepsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(13.3)\n\nNote that the internal pinchoff voltage is defined as a positive quantity.\n\nThe internal pinchoff voltage \\( V_{po} \\) is not the gate-to-source voltage to achieve pinchoff. The gate-to-source voltage that must be applied to achieve pinchoff is described as the **pinchoff voltage** and is also variously called the **turn-off voltage** or **threshold voltage**. The pinchoff voltage is denoted by \\( V_p \\) and is defined from Equations (13.1) and (13.2) as\n\n\\[\nV_p - V_s = V_{po} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad V_p = V_{th} - V_{po}\n\\]\n\n(13.4)\n\nThe gate-to-source voltage to achieve pinchoff in an n-channel depletion mode JFET is negative; thus, \\( V_{po} > V_{gs} \\).\n\n#### p-channel pn JFET\n\nFigure 13.10b shows a p-channel JFET with the same basic geometry as the n-channel JFET we considered. The induced depletion region for the one-sided n\\(^+\\)p junction is again denoted by \\( h \\) and is given by\n\n\\[\nh = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s (V_{bi} + V_{GS})}{e N_a} \\right]^{1/2} \\tag{13.5}\n\\]\n\nFor a reverse-biased n\\(^+\\)p junction, \\( V_{GS} \\) must be positive. The internal pinch-off voltage is again defined to be the total pn junction voltage to achieve pinch-off, so that when \\( h = a \\) we have\n\n\\[\na = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s V_{po}}{e N_a} \\right]^{1/2} \\tag{13.6}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nV_{po} = \\frac{ea^2 N_a}{2 \\varepsilon_s} \\tag{13.7}\n\\]\n\nThe internal pinch-off voltage for the p-channel device is also defined to be a positive quantity.\n\nThe pinch-off voltage is again defined as the gate-to-source voltage to achieve the pinch-off condition. For the p-channel depletion mode device, we have, from Equation (13.5), at pinch-off\n\n\\[\nV_{dA} + V_p = V_{po} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad V_p = V_{po} - V_{dA} \\tag{13.8}\n\\]\n\nThe pinch-off voltage for a p-channel depletion mode JFET is a positive quantity.\n\nAlso, we will see later that if the channel doping concentration were smaller the current capability of the device would decrease. There are definite tradeoffs to be considered in any design problem.\n\nWe have determined the pinch-off voltage for both n-channel and p-channel JFETs when the drain-to-source voltage is zero. Now consider the case when both gate and drain voltages are applied. The depletion region width will vary with distance through the channel. Figure 13.11 shows the simplified geometry for an n-channel device. The depletion width \\( h_t \\) at the source end is a function of \\( V_{bi} \\) and \\( V_{GS} \\) but is not a function of drain voltage. The depletion width at the drain terminal is given by\n\n\\[\nh_z = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s (V_{bi} + V_{DS} - V_{GS})}{e N_c} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(13.9)\n\nAgain, we must keep in mind that \\( V_{GS} \\) is a negative quantity for the n-channel device.\nPinchoff at the drain terminal occurs when \\( h_2 = a \\). At this point we reach what is known as the saturation condition; thus, we can write that \\( V_{DS} = V_{DS}(sat) \\). Then\n\n\\[\na = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s (V_{bi} + V_{DS}(sat) - V_{GS})}{eN_d} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(13.10)\n\nThis can be rewritten as\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} + V_{DS}(sat) - V_{GS} = \\frac{ea^2 N_d}{2 \\varepsilon_s} = V_{p0}\n\\]\n\n(13.11)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nV_{DS}(sat) = V_{p0} - (V_{bi} - V_{GS})\n\\]\n\n(13.12)\n\nEquation (13.12) gives the drain-to-source voltage to cause pinchoff at the drain terminal. The drain-to-source saturation voltage decreases with increasing reverse-biased gate-to-source voltage. We may note that Equation (13.12) has no meaning if \\( |V_{GS}| > |V_t| \\).\n\nIn a p-channel JFET, the voltage polarities are the reverse of those in the n-channel device. We can show that, in the p-channel JFET at saturation,\n\n\\[\nV_{SD}(sat) = V_{p0} - (V_{bi} + V_{GS})\n\\]\n\n(13.13)\n\nwhere now the source is positive with respect to the drain.\n\n### 13.2.2 Ideal DC Current–Voltage Relationship—Depletion Mode JFET\n\nThe derivation of the ideal current–voltage relation of the JFET is somewhat tedious, and the resulting equations are cumbersome in hand calculations. Before we go through this derivation, consider the following expression, which is a good approximation.\n\nto the I–V characteristics when the JFET is biased in the saturation region. This equation is used extensively in JFET applications and is given by\n\n\\[\nI_D = I_{\\text{DSS}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{GS}}{V_p} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n(13.14)\n\nwhere \\( I_{\\text{DSS}} \\) is the saturation current when \\( V_{GS} = 0 \\). At the end of this section, we compare the approximation given by Equation (13.14) and the ideal current–voltage equation that we have derived.\n\n#### I–V Derivation\n\nThe ideal current–voltage relationship of the JFET is derived by starting with Ohm’s law. Consider an n-channel JFET with the geometry shown in Figure 13.11. We are considering half of the two-sided symmetrical geometry. The differential resistance of the channel at a point \\( x \\) in the channel is\n\n\\[\ndR = \\frac{\\rho dx}{A(x)}\n\\]\n\n(13.15)\n\nwhere \\( \\rho \\) is the resistivity and \\( A(x) \\) is the cross-sectional area. If we neglect the minority carrier holes in the n channel, the channel resistivity is\n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{e \\mu_n N_d}\n\\]\n\n(13.16)\n\nThe cross-sectional area is given by\n\n\\[\nA(x) = [a - h(x)]W\n\\]\n\n(13.17)\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the channel width. Equation (13.15) can now be written as\n\n\\[\ndR = \\frac{dx}{e \\mu_n N_d [a - h(x)] W}\n\\]\n\n(13.18)\n\nThe differential voltage across a differential length \\( dx \\) can be written as\n\n\\[\ndV(x) = I_D dR(x)\n\\]\n\n(13.19)\n\nwhere the drain current \\( I_D \\) is constant through the channel. Substituting Equation (13.18) into Equation (13.19), we have\n\n\\[\ndV(x) = \\frac{I_D \\, dx}{e \\mu_n N_d W [a - h(x)]}\n\\]\n\n(13.20a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nI_D \\, dx = e \\mu_n N_d W [a - h(x)] \\, dV(x)\n\\]\n\n(13.20b)\n\nThe depletion width \\( h(x) \\) is given by\n\n\\[\nh(x) = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s [V(x) + V_b - V_{GS}]}{e N_d} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(13.21)\n\nwhere \\( V(x) \\) is the potential in the channel due to the drain-to-source voltage. Solving for \\( V(x) \\) in Equation (13.21) and taking the differential, we have\n\n\\[\ndV(x) = \\frac{e N_d h(x) \\, dh(x)}{\\varepsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(13.22)\n\nThen Equation (13.20b) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_{D1} \\, dx = \\frac{\\mu_n (eN_d)^2 W}{\\epsilon_s} \\left[ ah(x) \\, dh(x) - h(x)^2 \\, dh(x) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.23)\n\nThe drain current \\( I_{D1} \\) is found by integrating Equation (13.23) along the channel length. Assuming the current and mobility are constant through the channel, we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_{D1} = \\frac{\\mu_n (eN_d)^2 W}{\\epsilon_s L} \\left[ \\int_{h_m}^{h_2} ah \\, dh - \\int_{h_m}^{h_2} h^2 \\, dh \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.24)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nI_{D1} = \\frac{\\mu_n (eN_d)^2 W}{\\epsilon_s L} \\left[ \\frac{a}{2} (h_2^2 - h_m^2) - \\frac{1}{3} (h_2^3 - h_m^3) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.25)\n\nNoting that\n\n\\[\nh_2^2 = \\frac{2 \\epsilon_s (V_{DS} + V_{bi} - V_{GS})}{eN_d}\n\\]\n\n(13.26a)\n\n\\[\nh_m^2 = \\frac{2 \\epsilon_s (V_{bi} - V_{GS})}{eN_d}\n\\]\n\n(13.26b)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nV_{po} = \\frac{ea^2 N_d}{2 \\epsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(13.26c)\n\nEquation (13.25) can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_{D1} = \\frac{\\mu_n (eN_d)^2 Wa^3}{2 \\epsilon_s L} \\left[ \\frac{V_{DS}}{V_{po}} - \\frac{2}{3} \\left( \\frac{V_{DS} + V_{bi} - V_{GS}}{V_{po}} \\right)^{3/2} + \\frac{2}{3} \\left( \\frac{V_{bi} - V_{GS}}{V_{po}} \\right)^{3/2} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.27)\n\nWe may define\n\n\\[\nI_{p1} = \\frac{\\mu_n (eN_d)^2 Wa^3}{6 \\epsilon_s L}\n\\]\n\n(13.28)\n\nwhere \\( I_{p1} \\) is called the pinch-off current. Equation (13.27) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_{D1} = I_{p1} \\left[ 3 \\left( \\frac{V_{DS}}{V_{po}} \\right) - 2 \\left( \\frac{V_{DS} + V_{bi} - V_{GS}}{V_{po}} \\right)^{3/2} + 2 \\left( \\frac{V_{bi} - V_{GS}}{V_{po}} \\right)^{3/2} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.29)\n\nEquation (13.29) is valid for \\( 0 \\leq |V_{GS}| \\leq |V_t| \\) and \\( 0 \\leq V_{DS} \\leq V_{DS(sat)} \\). The pinch-off current \\( I_{p1} \\) would be the maximum drain current in the JFET if the zero-biased depletion regions could be ignored or if \\( V_{GS} \\) and \\( V_t \\) were both zero.\n\nEquation (13.29) is the current–voltage relationship for the one-sided n-channel JFET in the nonsaturation region. For the two-sided symmetrical JFET shown in Figure 13.9a, the total drain current would be \\( I_{D2} = 2I_{D1} \\).\n\nEquation (13.27) can also be written as\n\n\\[\nI_{D} = G_{o1} \\left\\{ V_{DS} - \\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{V_{po}}} \\left[ (V_{DS} + V_{bi} - V_{GS})^2 - (V_{bi} - V_{GS})^2 \\right] \\right\\}\n\\]\n\n(13.30)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nG_{o1} = \\frac{\\mu_n (eN_d)^{3/2} W_a^3}{2e_s L V_{po}} = \\frac{e \\mu_n N_d W_a}{L} = \\frac{3I_{p1}}{V_{po}}\n\\]\n\n(13.31)\n\nThe channel conductance is defined as\n\n\\[\ng_d = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\bigg|_{V_{DS}=0}\n\\]\n\n(13.32)\n\nTaking the derivative of Equation (13.30) with respect to \\(V_{DS}\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\ng_d = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\bigg|_{V_{DS}=0} = G_{o1} \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{V_{bi} - V_{GS}}{V_{po}} \\right)^2 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.33)\n\nWe may note from Equation (13.33) that \\(G_{o1}\\) would be the conductance of the channel if both \\(V_{bi}\\) and \\(V_{GS}\\) were zero. This condition would exist if no space charge regions existed in the channel. We may also note, from Equation (13.33), that the channel conductance is modulated or controlled by the gate voltage. This channel conductance modulation is the basis of the field-effect phenomenon.\n\nWe have shown that the drain becomes pinched off, for the n-channel JFET, when\n\n\\[\nV_{DS} = V_{DS(sat)} = V_{po} - (V_{bi} - V_{GS})\n\\]\n\n(13.34)\n\nIn the saturation region, the saturation drain current is determined by setting \\(V_{DS} = V_{DS(sat)}\\) in Equation (13.29) so that\n\n\\[\nI_{D} = I_{D(sat)} = I_{p1} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_{bi} - V_{GS}}{V_{po}} \\right) \\right] \\left[ 1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{bi} - V_{GS}}{V_{po}}} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.35)\n\nThe ideal saturation drain current is independent of the drain-to-source voltage. Figure 13.12 shows the ideal current–voltage characteristics of a silicon n-channel JFET.\n\n**Figure 13.12** Ideal current-voltage characteristics of a silicon n-channel JFET with \\(a = 1.5 \\, \\mu\\text{m}\\), \\(W/L = 170\\), and \\(N_g = 2.5 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\).  \n*(From Yang [22].)*\n\n| \\(V_{DS}\\) (V) | \\(I_D\\) (mA) |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| 0              | 0           |\n| 2              | 8           |\n| 4              | 16          |\n| 6              | 24          |\n| 8              | 28          |\n\n- **Nonsaturation region**: \\(V_{DS} < (V_{p0} - V_{gs}) + V_{GS}\\)\n- **Saturation region**: \\(V_{DS} \\geq (V_{p0} - V_{gs}) + V_{GS}\\)\n\n- \\(V_{GS} = 0, -1, -2, -3, -4 \\, \\text{V}\\)\n\n**Figure 13.13.1** Comparison of Equations (13.14) and (13.35) for the \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{GS} \\) characteristics of a JFET biased in the saturation region.\n\nWe may note that, for n-channel depletion mode JFET, both \\( V_{GS} \\) and \\( V_P \\) are negative and, for the p-channel depletion mode device, both are positive. Figure 13.13 shows the comparison between Equations (13.14) and (13.35).\n\n### 13.2.3 Transconductance\n\nThe transconductance is the transistor gain of the JFET; it indicates the amount of control the gate voltage has on the drain current. The transconductance is defined as\n\n\\[\ng_m = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}}\n\\]\n\n(13.37)\n\nUsing the expressions for the ideal drain current derived in the last section, we can write the expressions for the transconductance.\n\nThe drain current for an n-channel depletion mode device in the nonsaturation region is given by Equation (13.29). We can then determine the transconductance of the transistor in the same region as\n\n\\[\ng_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}} = \\frac{3I_{D1}}{V_{p0}} \\frac{V_{th} - V_{GS}}{V_{p0}} \\left[ \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{DS}}{V_{th} - V_{GS}}} + 1 - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.38)\n\nTaking the limit as \\( V_{DS} \\) becomes small, the transconductance becomes\n\n\\[\ng_{m} \\approx \\frac{3I_{D1}}{2V_{p0}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{DS}}{\\sqrt{V_{th}(V_{th} - V_{GS})}}\n\\]\n\n(13.39)\n\nWe can also write Equation (13.39) in terms of the conductance parameter \\( G_{0} \\) as\n\n\\[\ng_{m} = \\frac{G_{0}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{V_{DS}}{\\sqrt{V_{th}(V_{th} - V_{GS})}}\n\\]\n\n(13.40)\n\nThe ideal drain current in the saturation region for the JFET is given by Equation (13.35). The transconductance in the saturation region is then found to be\n\n\\[\ng_m = \\frac{\\partial I_D(\\text{sat})}{\\partial V_{GS}} = \\frac{3I_{DSS}}{V_p} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{GS} - V_{GS}}{V_p}} \\right) = G_{0} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{GS} - V_{GS}}{V_p}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(13.41a)\n\nUsing the current–voltage approximation given by Equation (13.14), we can also write the transconductance as\n\n\\[\ng_m = -\\frac{2I_{DSS}}{V_p} \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{GS}}{V_p} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(13.41b)\n\nSince \\( V_p \\) is negative for the n-channel JFET, \\( g_m \\) is positive.\n\nThe experimental transconductance may deviate from this ideal expression due to a source series resistance. This effect will be considered later in the discussion of the small signal model of the JFET.\n\n### 13.2.4 The MESFET\n\nSo far in our discussion, we have explicitly considered the pn JFET. The MESFET is the same basic device except that the pn junction is replaced by a Schottky barrier rectifying junction. The simplified MESFET geometry is shown in Figure 13.9b. MESFETs are usually fabricated in gallium arsenide. We will neglect any depletion region that may exist between the n channel and the substrate. We have also limited our discussion to depletion mode devices, wherein a gate-to-source voltage is applied to turn the transistor off. Enhancement mode GaAs MESFETs can be fabricated—their basic operation is discussed in Section 13.1.2. We can also consider enhancement mode GaAs pn JFETs.\nSince the electron mobility in GaAs is much larger than the hole mobility, we will concentrate our discussion on n-channel GaAs MESFETs or JFETs. The definition of internal pinch-off voltage, given by Equation (13.3), also applies to these devices. In considering the enhancement mode JFET, the term threshold voltage is commonly used in place of pinch-off voltage. For this reason, we shall use the term threshold voltage in our discussion of MESFETs.\n\nFor the n-channel MESFET, the threshold voltage is defined from Equation (13.4) as\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} - V_T = V_{\\phi 0} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad V_T = V_{bi} - V_{\\phi 0}\n\\]\n\n(13.42)\n\nFor an n-channel depletion mode JFET, \\( V_T < 0 \\), and for the enhancement mode device, \\( V_T > 0 \\). We can see from Equation (13.42) that \\( V_{bi} > V_{\\phi 0} \\) for an enhancement mode n-channel JFET.\n\nThe design of enhancement mode JFETs implies the use of narrow channel thicknesses and low channel doping concentrations to achieve this condition. The precise control of the channel thickness and doping concentration necessary to achieve internal pinchoff voltages of a few tenths of a volt makes the fabrication of enhancement mode MESFETs difficult.\n\nIdeally, the I-V characteristics of the enhancement mode device are the same as the depletion mode device—the only real difference is the relative values of the internal pinchoff voltage. The current in the saturation region is given by Equation (13.35) as\n\n\\[\nI_{D1} = I_{D1}(\\text{sat}) = I_{p1} \\left\\{ 1 - 3 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \\right] + 2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \\right]^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\right\\}\n\\]\n\nThe threshold voltage for the n-channel device is defined in Equation (13.42) as \\(V_T = V_{bi} - V_{p0}\\), so we can also write\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = V_T + V_{p0}\n\\]\n\n(13.43)\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\(V_{bi}\\) into Equation (13.35), we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_{D1}(\\text{sat}) = I_{p1} \\left\\{ 1 - 3 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \\right] + 2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{(V_{GS} - V_T)}{V_{p0}} \\right]^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\right\\}\n\\]\n\n(13.44)\n\nEquation (13.44) is valid for \\(V_{GS} \\geq V_T\\).\n\nWhen the transistor first turns on, we have \\((V_{GS} - V_T) \\ll V_{p0}\\). Equation (13.44) can then be expanded into a Taylor series and we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_{D1}(\\text{sat}) \\approx I_{p1} \\left[ \\frac{3}{4} \\left( \\frac{V_{GS} - V_T}{V_{p0}} \\right)^2 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(13.45)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(I_{p1}\\) and \\(V_{p0}\\), Equation (13.45) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_{D1}(\\text{sat}) = \\frac{\\mu_n \\epsilon_s W}{2aL} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad V_{GS} \\geq V_T\n\\]\n\n(13.46)\n\nWe can now write Equation (13.46) as\n\n\\[\nI_{D1}(\\text{sat}) = k_n (V_{GS} - V_T)^2\n\\]\n\n(13.47)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nk_n = \\frac{\\mu_n \\epsilon_s W}{2aL}\n\\]\n\n(13.48)\n\nThe factor \\(k_n\\) is called a conduction parameter. The form of Equation (13.47) is the same as for a MOSFET.\n\n**Figure 13.14** | Experimental and theoretical \\(\\sqrt{I_D}\\) versus \\(V_{GS}\\) characteristics of an enhancement mode JFET.\n\nThe square root of Equation (13.47), or \\(\\sqrt{I_{D(sat)}}\\) versus \\(V_{GS}\\), is plotted as the ideal dotted curve shown in Figure 13.14. The ideal curve intersects the voltage axis at the threshold voltage, \\(V_r\\). The solid line shows an experimental plot. Equation (13.46) does not describe the experimental results well near the threshold voltage. The ideal current–voltage relationship is derived assuming an abrupt depletion approximation for the pn junction. However, when the depletion region extends almost through the channel, a more accurate model of the space charge region must be used to more accurately predict the drain current characteristics near threshold. We consider the subthreshold conduction in Section 13.3.3.",

In all of the previous discussions, we have considered an ideal transistor with a constant channel length and constant mobility; we have also...\n\n### 13.3.1 Channel Length Modulation\n\nThe expression for the drain current is inversely proportional to the channel length \\( L \\) as given, for example, by Equation (13.27). In deriving the current equations, we have implicitly assumed that the channel length was constant. However, the effective channel length can change. Figure 13.5 shows the space charge region in the channel when the transistor is biased in the saturation region. The neutral n-channel length decreases as \\( V_{DS} \\) increases; thus, the drain current will increase. The change in the effective channel length and the corresponding change in drain current is called channel length modulation.\n\nThe pinchoff current, Equation (13.28), is modified by the channel length modulation and can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_{p1} = \\frac{\\mu_n (eN_d)^2 W a^3}{6 \\epsilon_s L'}\n\\]\n\n(13.50)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nL' \\approx L - \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta L\n\\]\n\n(13.51)\n\nIf we assume the channel depletion region shown in Figure 13.5 extends equally into the channel and drain regions, then as a first approximation, we will include the factor \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in the expression for \\( L' \\).\n\nThe drain current can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_{D1} = I_{D0} \\frac{I_{p1}}{I_{p1}} = I_{D0} \\left( \\frac{L}{L - \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta L} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(13.52)\n\nwhere \\( I_{D0} \\) is the ideal drain current predicted by Equation (13.35).

Channel length modulation and other effects become very important in short-channel devices.\n\n### 13.3.2 Velocity Saturation Effects\n\nWe have seen that the drift velocity of a carrier in silicon saturates with increasing electric field. This velocity saturation effect implies that the mobility is not a constant. For very short channels, the carriers can easily reach their saturation velocity, which changes the I-V characteristics of the JFET.\n\nFigure 13.15 shows the channel region with an applied drain voltage. As the channel narrows at the drain terminal, the velocity of the carriers increases since the current through the channel is constant. The carriers first saturate at the drain end of the channel. The depletion region will reach a saturation thickness, so we can write\n\n\\[\nI_{D}(sat) = eN_{d}v_{sat}(a - h_{sat})W\n\\]\n\n(13.56)\n\nwhere \\( v_{sat} \\) is the saturation velocity and \\( h_{sat} \\) is the saturation depletion width. This saturation effect occurs at a drain voltage smaller than the \\( V_{DS}(sat) \\) value determined previously. Both \\( I_{DS}(sat) \\) and \\( V_{DS}(sat) \\) will be smaller than previously calculated.\n\nFigure 13.16 shows normalized plots of \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\). Figure 13.16a is for the case of a constant mobility and Figure 13.16b is for the case of velocity saturation. Since the I-V characteristics change when velocity saturation occurs, the transconductance will also change—the transconductance will become smaller; hence, the effective gain of the transistor decreases when velocity saturation occurs.\n\n### 13.3.3 Subthreshold and Gate Current Effects\n\nThe subthreshold current is the drain current in the JFET that exists when the gate voltage is below the pinchoff or threshold value. The subthreshold conduction is shown in Figure 13.14. When the JFET is biased in the saturation region, the drain current varies quadratically with gate-to-source voltage. When \\( V_{GS} \\) is below the threshold value, the drain current varies exponentially with gate-to-source voltage. Near threshold, the abrupt depletion approximation does not accurately model the channel region: A more detailed potential profile in the space charge region must be used. However, these calculations are beyond the scope of this chapter.\n\nWhen the gate voltage is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 V below threshold in an n-channel MESFET, the drain current reaches a minimum value and then slowly increases as the gate voltage decreases. The drain current in this region is the gate leakage current. Figure 13.17 is a plot of the drain current versus \\( V_{GS} \\) for the three regions.\n\n**Figure 13.16** | Normalized \\( I_D \\) versus \\( V_{DS} \\) plots for a constant mobility and field-dependent mobility.  \n*(From Sze [19].)*\n\n**Figure 13.17** | Measured drain current versus \\( V_{GS} \\) for a GaAs MESFET showing the normal drain current, subthreshold current, and gate leakage current.  \n*(From Daring [21].)*",

    "text": "## 13.4 Equivalent Circuit and Frequency Limitations\n\nIn order to analyze a transistor circuit, one needs a mathematical model or equivalent circuit of the transistor. One of the most useful models is the small-signal equivalent circuit, which applies to transistors used in linear amplifier circuits. This equivalent circuit will introduce frequency effects in the transistor through the equivalent capacitor–resistor circuits. The various physical factors in the JFET affecting the frequency limitations are considered here and a transistor cutoff frequency, which is a figure of merit, is then defined.\n\n### 13.4.1 Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit\n\nThe cross section of an n-channel pn JFET is shown in Figure 13.18, including source and drain series resistances. The substrate may be semi-insulating gallium arsenide or it may be a p+ type substrate.\n\nFigure 13.19 shows a small-signal equivalent circuit for the JFET. The voltage \\( V_{g'} \\) is the internal gate-to-source voltage that controls the drain current. The \\( r_g \\) and \\( C_{gs} \\) parameters are the gate-to-source diffusion resistance and junction capacitance, respectively. The gate-to-source junction is reverse biased for depletion mode devices and has only a small forward-bias voltage for enhancement mode devices, so that normally \\( r_g \\) is large. The parameters \\( r_d \\) and \\( C_{gd} \\) are the gate-to-drain resistance and capacitance, respectively. The resistance \\( r_{ds} \\) is the finite drain resistance, which is a function of the channel length modulation effect. The \\( C_d \\) capacitance is mainly a drain-to-source parasitic capacitance and \\( C_s \\) is the drain-to-substrate capacitance.\n\nThe ideal small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 13.20a. All diffusion resistances are infinite, the series resistances are zero, and at low frequency the\n\n**Figure 13.20** (a) Ideal low-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit. (b) Ideal equivalent circuit including \\( r_s \\).\n\nCapacitances become open circuits. The small-signal drain current is now\n\n\\[\nI_{ds} = g_m V_{gs}\n\\]\n\n(13.57)\n\nwhich is a function only of the transconductance and the input-signal voltage.\n\nThe effect of the source series resistance can be determined using Figure 13.20b. We have\n\n\\[\nI_{ds} = g_m V_{gs}'\n\\]\n\n(13.58)\n\nThe relation between \\( V_{gs} \\) and \\( V_{gs}' \\) can be found from\n\n\\[\nV_{gs} = V_{gs}' + (g_m V_{gs}') r_s = (1 + g_m r_s) V_{gs}'\n\\]\n\n(13.59)\n\nEquation (13.58) can then be written as\n\n\\[\nI_{ds} = \\left( \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m r_s} \\right) V_{gs} = g_m' V_{gs}\n\\]\n\n(13.60)\n\nThe effect of the source resistance is to reduce the effective transconductance or transistor gain.\n\nRecall that \\( g_m \\) is a function of the dc gate-to-source voltage, so \\( g_m' \\) will also be a function of \\( V_{GS} \\). Equation (13.41b) is the relation between \\( g_m \\) and \\( V_{GS} \\) when the...\n\n**Figure 13.21** JFET transconductance versus \\( V_{GS} \\) (a) without and (b) with a source series resistance.\n\n**Figure 13.22** A small-signal equivalent circuit with capacitance.\n\nThe transistor is biased in the saturation region. Figure 13.21 shows a comparison between the theoretical and experimental transconductance values using the parameters from Example 13.4 and letting \\( r_s = 2000 \\, \\Omega \\). (A value of \\( r_s = 2000 \\, \\Omega \\) may seem excessive, but keep in mind that the active thickness of the semiconductor may be on the order of 1 \\(\\mu m\\) or less; thus, a large series resistance may result if special care is not taken.)\n\n### 13.4.2 Frequency Limitation Factors and Cutoff Frequency\n\nThere are two frequency limitation factors in a JFET. The first is the channel transit time. If we assume a channel length of 1 \\(\\mu m\\) and assume carriers are traveling at their saturation velocity, then the transit time is on the order of\n\n\\[\n\\tau_t = \\frac{L}{v_s} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-4}}{1 \\times 10^7} = 10 \\, \\text{ps}\n\\]\n\n(13.61)\n\nThe channel transit time is normally not the limiting factor except in very high frequency devices.\n\nThe second frequency limitation factor is the capacitance charging time. Figure 13.22 is a simplified equivalent circuit that includes the primary capacitances and ignores the diffusion resistances. The output current will be the short-circuit current. As the frequency of the input-signal voltage \\( V_g \\) increases, the impedance of \\( C_{gd} \\) and \\( C_{gp} \\) decreases so the current through \\( C_{gd} \\) will increase. For a constant \\( g_m V_{gs} \\), the \\( I_d \\) current will then decrease. The output current then becomes a function of frequency.\n\nIf the capacitance charging time is the limiting factor, then the cutoff frequency \\( f_T \\) is defined as the frequency at which the magnitude of the input current \\( I_i \\) is equal to the magnitude of the ideal output current \\( g_m V_{gs} \\) of the intrinsic transistor. We have,\n\nWhen the output is short-circuited,\n\n\\[\nI_t = j\\omega (C_P + C_{pd})V_{gs}\n\\]\n\n(13.62)\n\nIf we let \\( C_G = C_P + C_{pd} \\), then at the cutoff frequency\n\n\\[\n|I| = 2\\pi f_T C_G V_{gs} = g_m V_{gs}\n\\]\n\n(13.63)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nf_T = \\frac{g_m}{2\\pi C_G}\n\\]\n\n(13.64)\n\nFrom Equation (13.41b), the maximum possible transconductance is\n\n\\[\ng_m (\\text{max}) = g_{0m} = \\frac{e\\mu_n N_d w a}{L}\n\\]\n\n(13.65)\n\nand the minimum gate capacitance is\n\n\\[\nC_G (\\text{min}) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_s WL}{a}\n\\]\n\n(13.66)\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the maximum space charge width. The maximum cutoff frequency can be written as\n\n\\[\nf_T = \\frac{e\\mu_n N_d a^2}{2\\pi \\varepsilon_s L^2}\n\\]\n\n(13.67)\n\nFor gallium arsenide JFETs or MESFETs with very small geometries, the cutoff frequency is even larger. The channel transit time may also become a factor in very high frequency devices, in which case the expression for cutoff frequency would need to be modified.\n\n\nOne application of GaAs FETs is in ultrafast digital integrated circuits. Conventional GaAs MESFET logic gates can achieve propagation delay times in the subnanosecond range. These delay times are at least comparable to, if not shorter than, fast ECL, but the power dissipation is three orders of magnitude smaller than in the ECL circuits. Enhancement mode GaAs JFETs have been used as drivers in logic circuits, and depletion mode devices may be used as loads. Propagation delay times of as low as 45 ps have been observed. Special JFET structures may be used to further increase the speed. These structures include the modulation-doped field-effect transistor, which is discussed in the following section.",

    "text": "## 13.5| High Electron Mobility Transistor\n\nAs frequency needs, power capacity, and low noise performance requirements increase, the gallium arsenide MESFET is pushed to its limit of design and performance. These requirements imply a very small FET with a short channel length, large saturation current, and large transconductance. These requirements are generally achieved by increasing the channel doping under the gate. In all of the devices we have considered, the channel region is in a doped layer of bulk semiconductor with the majority carriers and doping impurities in the same region. The majority carriers experience ionized impurity scattering, which reduces carrier mobility and degrades device performance.\n\nThe degradation in mobility and peak velocity in GaAs due to increased doping can be minimized by separating the majority carriers from the ionized impurities. This separation can be achieved in a heterostructure that has an abrupt discontinuity in conduction and valence bands. We considered the basic heterojunction properties in Chapter 9. Figure 13.23 shows the conduction-band energy relative to the Fermi energy of an N-AlGaAs-intrinsic GaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium is achieved when electrons from the wide-bandgap AlGaAs flow into the GaAs and are confined to the potential well. However, the electrons are free to move parallel to the heterojunction interface. In this structure, the majority carrier\n\n**Figure 13.23** | Conduction-band edges for N-AlGaAs–intrinsic GaAs abrupt heterojunction.\n\nThe electrons in the potential well are now separated from the impurity dopant atoms in the AlGaAs; thus, impurity scattering tends to be minimized.\n\nThe FETs fabricated from these heterojunctions are known by several names. The term used here is the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Other names include modulation-doped field-effect transistor (MODFET), selectively doped heterojunction field-effect transistor (SDHT), and two-dimensional electron gas field-effect transistor (TEGFET).\n\n### 13.5.1 Quantum Well Structures\n\nFigure 13.23 shows the conduction-band energy of an N-AlGaAs–intrinsic GaAs heterojunction. A two-dimensional surface channel layer of electrons is formed in the thin potential well (~80Å) in the undoped GaAs. Electron sheet carrier densities on the order of \\(10^{12} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\) have been obtained. An improvement in the low-field mobility of the carriers moving parallel to the heterojunction is observed since the impurity-scattering effects are reduced. At 300 K, mobilities have been reported in the range of 8500–9000 \\(\\text{cm}^2/\\text{V·s}\\), whereas GaAs MESFETs doped to \\(N_d = 10^{17} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\) have low-field mobilities of less than 5000 \\(\\text{cm}^2/\\text{V·s}\\). The electron mobility in the heterojunction now tends to be dominated by lattice or phonon scattering, so that as the temperature is reduced, the mobility increases rapidly.\n\nImpurity-scattering effects can be further reduced by increasing the separation of the electrons and ionized donor impurities. The electrons in the potential well of the abrupt heterojunction shown in Figure 13.23 are separated from the donor atoms, but are still close enough to be subjected to a coulomb attraction. A thin spacer layer of undoped AlGaAs can be placed between the doped AlGaAs and the undoped GaAs. Figure 13.24 shows the energy-band diagram for this structure.\n\nFigure 13.24\n\nConduction-band edges for N-AlGaAs–undoped AlGaAs–undoped GaAs heterojunction.\n\n(From Shur [13].)\n\n\n- **(a)** 2-D electron gas\n- **(b)** Energy-band diagram\n\n- \\(x = 0.35\\)\n- \\((\\text{Al}, \\text{Ga})\\text{As} = 1.5 \\times 10^{18} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\)\n- \\(N_s = 1.14 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\)\n- \\(T = 300 \\, K\\)\n\n- \\(E_0\\), \\(E_i\\), \\(E_F\\) are energy levels\n- \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\), \\(Z_1\\), \\(Z_2\\) are distances\n\nThe diagram illustrates the separation of doped and undoped regions, showing the potential well and electron gas formation.\nseparation between the carriers and ionized donors increases further the electron mobility, since there is even less coulomb interaction. One disadvantage of this graded heterojunction is that the electron density in the potential well tends to be smaller than in the abrupt junction.\n\nThe molecular beam epitaxial process allows the growth of very thin layers of specific semiconductor materials with specific dopings. In particular, a multilayer modulation–doped heterostructure can be formed, as shown in Figure 13.25. Several surface channel layers of electrons are formed in parallel. This structure would be equivalent to increasing the channel electron density, which would increase the current capability of the FET.\n\n### 13.5.2 Transistor Performance\n\nA typical HEMT structure is shown in Figure 13.26. The N-AlGaAs is separated from the undoped GaAs by an undoped AlGaAs spacer. A Schottky contact to the N-AlGaAs forms the gate of the transistor. This structure is a “normal” MODFET. An “inverted” structure is shown in Figure 13.27. In this case the Schottky contact is made to the undoped GaAs layer. The inverted MODFET has been investigated less than the normal structure because the normal structure has yielded superior results.\n\nThe density of electrons in the two-dimensional electron gas layer in the potential well can be controlled by the gate voltage. The electric field of the Schottky gate depletes the two-dimensional electron gas layer in the potential well when a\n\n**Figure 13.25** | Multilayer modulation–doped heterostructure.\n\n| Layer                  | Thickness |\n|------------------------|-----------|\n| Doped AlGaAs           | 300 Å     |\n| Undoped GaAs           | 300 Å     |\n| Doped AlGaAs           | 250 Å     |\n| Undoped GaAs           | 300 Å     |\n| Doped AlGaAs           | 150 Å     |\n| Undoped GaAs           | 300 Å     |\n| Doped AlGaAs           | 50 Å      |\n| Undoped AlGaAs spacer  | 0.2 μm    |\n| Undoped buffer         | 1 μm      |\n\n- Al = 0.2 to 0.25\n- Semi-insulating substrate\n\n**Figure 13.26** | A “normal” AlGaAs–GaAs HEMT.\n\n- Source\n- Drain\n- n⁺ AlGaAs\n- Undoped AlGaAs spacer\n- Undoped GaAs buffer\n- Semi-insulating GaAs substrate\n- 2-D electron gas\n- Ohmic contact\n- n⁺GaAs Gate\n\n**Figure 13.27** | An \"inverted\" GaAs–AlGaAs HEMT.  \n*(From Shur [13].)*\n\n\n**Figure 13.28** | Energy-band diagram of a normal HEMT  \n(a) with zero gate bias and (b) with a negative gate bias.\n\nSufficiently large negative voltage is applied to the gate. Figure 13.28 shows the energy-band diagrams of the metal–AlGaAs–GaAs structure under zero bias and with a reverse bias applied to the gate. With zero bias, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is below the Fermi level, implying a large density of the two-dimensional electron gas. With a negative voltage applied to the gate, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is above the Fermi level, implying that the density of the two-dimensional electron gas is very small and the current in an FET would be essentially zero.\n\nThe Schottky barrier depletes the AlGaAs layer from the surface, and the heterojunction depletes the AlGaAs layer from the heterojunction interface. Ideally the device should be designed so that the two depletion regions just overlap to prevent electron conduction through the AlGaAs layer. For depletion mode devices, the depletion layer from the Schottky gate should extend only to the heterojunction depletion layer. For enhancement mode devices, the thickness of the doped AlGaAs layer is smaller and the Schottky gate built-in potential barrier will completely...\n\n\nThe density of the two-dimensional electron gas in a normal structure can be described using a charge control model.

If a positive gate voltage is applied, the density of the two-dimensional electron gas will increase. Increasing the gate voltage will increase the two-dimensional electron gas density until the conduction band of the AlGaAs crosses the Fermi level of the electron gas. Figure 13.29 shows this effect. At this point, the gate loses control over the electron gas since a parallel conduction path in the AlGaAs has been formed.\n\n**Figure 13.29** | Energy-band diagram of an enhancement mode HEMT (a) with a slight forward gate voltage, and (b) with a larger forward gate voltage that creates a conduction channel in the AlGaAs. (From Fritzsche [5].)\n\nThe current–voltage characteristics of the MODFET can be found using the charge control model and the gradual channel approximation. The channel carrier concentration can be written as\n\n\\[\nn_s(x) = \\frac{q\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0}{qd + \\Delta d} [V_g - V_{off} - V(x)]\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(V(x)\\) is the potential along the channel due to the drain-to-source voltage. The drain current is\n\n\\[\nI_D = qn_s v(E)W\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(v(E)\\) is the carrier drift velocity and \\(W\\) is the channel width. This analysis is very similar to that for the pn JFET in Section 13.2.2.\n\nIf we assume a constant mobility, then for low \\(V_{DS}\\) values, we have\n\n\\[\nI_D = \\frac{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 \\mu W}{2L(d + \\Delta d)} [2(V_g - V_{off}) V_{DS} - V_{DS}^2]\n\\]\n\nThe form of this equation is the same as that for the pn JFET or MESFET operating in the nonsaturation region. If \\(V_{DS}\\) increases so that the carriers reach the saturation velocity, then\n\n\\[\nI_{D(sat)} = \\frac{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 v_s W}{d + \\Delta d} (V_g - V_{off} - V_0)_{v_{sat}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_{sat}\\) is the saturation velocity and \\(V_0 = E_s L\\) with \\(E_s\\) being the electric field in the channel that produces the saturation velocity.\n\nVarious velocity versus electric field models can be used to derive different \\( I\\text{-}V \\) expressions. However, Equations (13.74) and (13.75) yield satisfactory results for most situations. Figure 13.30 shows a comparison between experimental and calculated \\( I\\text{-}V \\) characteristics. As observed in the figure, the current in these heterojunction devices can be quite large. The transconductance of the MODFET is defined as it was for the pn JFET and MESFET. Typical measured values at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) are in the range of 250 mS/mm. Higher values have been reported. These transconductance values are significantly larger than for either the pn JFET or the MESFET.\n\nHEMTs may also be fabricated with multiple heterojunction layers. This device type is shown in Figure 13.31. A single heterojunction for an AlGaAs–GaAs interface has a maximum two-dimensional electron sheet density on the order of \\( 1 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\). This concentration can be increased by fabricating two or more AlGaAs–GaAs interfaces in the same epitaxial layer. The device current capacity is increased, and power performance is improved. The multichannel HEMT behaves as multiple single-channel HEMTs connected in parallel and modulated by the same gate but with slightly different threshold voltages. The maximum transconductance will not scale directly with the number of channels because of the change in threshold voltage with each channel. In addition, the effective channel length increases as the distance between the gate and channel increases.\n\nHEMTs can be used in high-speed logic circuits. They have been used in flip-flop circuits operating at clock frequencies of 5.5 GHz at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\); the clock frequency can be increased at lower temperatures. Small-signal, high-frequency amplifiers have also been investigated. HEMTs showing low noise and reasonable gains have been operated at 35 GHz. The maximum frequency increases as the channel length decreases. Cutoff frequencies on the order of 100 GHz have been measured with channel lengths of 0.25 \\(\\mu\\text{m}\\).\n\n\n**Figure 13.30** | Current–voltage characteristics of an enhancement mode HEMT, in which solid curves are numerical calculations and dots are measured points.  \n*(From Shur [13].)*\n\n\n**Figure 13.31** | A multilayer HEMT.\n\nIt seems clear that HEMTs are inherently superior to other FET technologies in terms of achieving higher speeds of operation, lower power dissipation, and lower noise. These advantages derive directly from the superior transport properties obtained by using undoped GaAs as the channel layer for the FET. One way to achieve an adequate carrier concentration in an undoped channel is to accumulate the carriers at a semiconductor heterojunction interface, as we have seen. The disadvantage of the HEMT is that the fabrication processes for the heterojunction are more complicated.",

The current is in the channel region between the source and drain contacts. In a pn JFET, the channel forms one side of a pn junction that is used to modulate the channel conductance.\n- Two primary parameters of the JFET are the internal pinchoff voltage \\( V_0 \\) and the pinchoff voltage \\( V_p \\). The internal pinchoff voltage is defined as a positive quantity and is the total gate-to-channel potential that causes the junction space charge layer to completely fill the channel region. The pinchoff voltage is defined as the gate voltage that must be applied to achieve the pinchoff condition.\n- The ideal current–voltage relationship is derived. The transconductance, or transistor gain, is the rate of change of drain current with respect to the corresponding change in gate-to-source voltage.\n- Three nonideal effects are considered; channel-length modulation, velocity saturation, and subthreshold current. Each of these effects changes the ideal current–voltage relationship.\n- A small-signal equivalent circuit of the JFET is developed. The equivalent circuit includes capacitances that introduce frequency effects in the transistor. Two physical factors affect the frequency limitation; channel transit time and capacitance charging time. The capacitance charging time constant is normally the limiting factor in short channel devices.\n- The high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure utilizes a heterojunction. A two-dimensional electron gas is confined to a potential well at the heterojunction interface. However, the electrons are free to move parallel to the interface. These electrons are separated from the ionized donors so that ionized impurity scattering effects are minimized, resulting in a high mobility.",

    "text": "## 14.1 OPTICAL ABSORPTION\n\nIn Chapter 2, we discussed the wave–particle duality principle and indicated that light waves could be treated as particles, which are referred to as photons. The energy of a photon is \\( E = h\\nu \\) where \\( h \\) is Planck’s constant and \\( \\nu \\) is the frequency. We can also relate the wavelength and energy by\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{c}{\\nu} = \\frac{hc}{E} = \\frac{1.24}{E} \\, \\text{μm}\n\\]\n\n(14.1)\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the photon energy in eV and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nThere are several possible photon–semiconductor interaction mechanisms. For example, photons can interact with the semiconductor lattice whereby the photon energy is converted into heat. Photons can also interact with impurity atoms, either donors or acceptors, or they can interact with defects within the semiconductor. However, the basic photon interaction process of greatest interest is the interaction with valence electrons. When a photon collides with a valence electron, enough energy may be imparted to elevate the electron into the conduction band. Such a process generates electron–hole pairs and creates excess carrier concentrations. The behavior of excess carriers in a semiconductor was considered in Chapter 6.\n\n### 14.1.1 Photon Absorption Coefficient\n\nWhen a semiconductor is illuminated with light, the photons may be absorbed or they may propagate through the semiconductor, depending on the photon energy and on the bandgap energy \\( E_g \\). If the photon energy is less than \\( E_g \\), the photons are not readily absorbed. In this case, the light is transmitted through the material and the semiconductor appears to be transparent.\n\nIf \\( E = h\\nu > E_g \\), the photon can interact with a valence electron and elevate the electron into the conduction band. The valence band contains many electrons and the conduction band contains many empty states, so the probability of this interaction is high when \\( h\\nu > E_g \\). This interaction creates an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band—an electron–hole pair. The basic absorption processes for different values of \\( h\\nu \\) are shown in Figure 14.1. When \\( h\\nu > E_g \\), an electron–hole pair is generated.\n\n**Figure 14.1.1** Optically generated electron–hole pair formation in a semiconductor.\n\nThe intensity of the photon flux is denoted by \\( I_{\\nu}(x) \\) and is expressed in terms of energy/cm\\(^2\\)-s. Figure 14.2 shows an incident photon intensity at a position \\( x \\) and the photon flux emerging at a distance \\( x + dx \\). The energy absorbed per unit time in the distance \\( dx \\) is given by\n\n\\[\n\\alpha I_{\\nu}(x) dx\n\\]\n\n(14.2)\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha \\) is the absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient is the relative number of photons absorbed per unit distance, given in units of cm\\(^{-1}\\).\n\nFrom Figure 14.2, we can write\n\n\\[\nI_{\\nu}(x + dx) - I_{\\nu}(x) = \\frac{dI_{\\nu}(x)}{dx} \\cdot dx = -\\alpha I_{\\nu}(x) dx\n\\]\n\n(14.3)\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dI_{\\nu}(x)}{dx} = -\\alpha I_{\\nu}(x)\n\\]\n\n(14.4)\n\nIf the initial condition is given as \\( I_{\\nu}(0) = I_{\\nu 0} \\), then the solution to the differential equation, Equation (14.4), is\n\n\\[\nI_{\\nu}(x) = I_{\\nu 0} e^{-\\alpha x}\n\\]\n\n(14.5)\n\nThe intensity of the photon flux decreases exponentially with distance through the semiconductor material. The photon intensity as a function of \\( x \\) for two general values of absorption coefficient is shown in Figure 14.3. If the absorption coefficient is large, the photons are absorbed over a relatively short distance.\n\nThe absorption coefficient in the semiconductor is a very strong function of photon energy and bandgap energy. Figure 14.4 shows the absorption coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) plotted as a function of wavelength for several semiconductor materials. The absorption coefficient increases very rapidly for \\( h\\nu > E_g \\), or for \\( \\lambda < 1.24/E_g \\).\n\n- **Figure 14.2**: Optical absorption in a differential length.\n\n- **Figure 14.3**: Photon intensity versus distance for two absorption coefficients.\n\n**Figure 14.4** | Absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength for several semiconductors.  \n*(From Shur [13].)*\n\nThe coefficients are very small for \\( h\\nu < E_g \\), so the semiconductor appears transparent to photons in this energy range.\n\nThe relation between the bandgap energies of some of the common semiconductor materials and the light spectrum is shown in Figure 14.5.

    "text": "## 14.2 | SOLAR CELLS\n\nA solar cell is a pn junction device with no voltage directly applied across the junction. The solar cell converts photon power into electrical power and delivers this power to a load. These devices have long been used for the power supply of satellites and space vehicles, and also as the power supply to some calculators. We will first consider the simple pn junction solar cell with uniform generation of excess carriers. We will also discuss briefly the heterojunction and amorphous silicon solar cells.\n\n### 14.2.1 The pn Junction Solar Cell\n\nConsider the pn junction shown in Figure 14.6 with a resistive load. Even with zero bias applied to the junction, an electric field exists in the space charge region as shown in the figure. Incident photon illumination can create electron–hole pairs in the space charge region that will be swept out producing the photocurrent \\( I_L \\) in the reverse-biased direction as shown.\n\nThe photocurrent \\( I_L \\) produces a voltage drop across the resistive load which forward biases the pn junction. The forward-bias voltage produces a forward-bias current \\( I_F \\) as indicated in the figure. The net pn junction current, in the reverse-biased direction, is\n\n\\[\nI = I_L - I_F = I_L - I_S \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(14.7)\n\n**Figure 14.6 | A pn junction solar cell with resistive load.**\n\n**Figure 14.7** I–V characteristics of a pn junction solar cell.\n\nwhere the ideal diode equation has been used. As the diode becomes forward biased, the magnitude of the electric field in the space charge region decreases, but does not go to zero or change direction. The photocurrent is always in the reverse-biased direction and the net solar cell current is also always in the reverse-biased direction.\n\nThere are two limiting cases of interest. The short-circuit condition occurs when \\( R = 0 \\) so that \\( V = 0 \\). The current in this case is referred to as the **short-circuit current**, or\n\n\\[\nI = I_{sc} = I_L\n\\]\n\n(14.8)\n\nThe second limiting case is the open-circuit condition and occurs when \\( R \\rightarrow \\infty \\). The net current is zero and the voltage produced is the **open-circuit voltage**. The photocurrent is just balanced by the forward-biased junction current, so we have\n\n\\[\nI = 0 = I_L - I_s \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(14.9)\n\nWe can find the open circuit voltage \\( V_{oc} \\) as\n\n\\[\nV_{oc} = V_t \\ln \\left( 1 + \\frac{I_L}{I_s} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(14.10)\n\nA plot of the diode current \\( I \\) as a function of the diode voltage \\( V \\) from Equation (14.7) is shown in Figure 14.7. We may note the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage points on the figure.\n\nThe power delivered to the load is\n\n\\[\nP = I \\cdot V = I_L \\cdot V - I_s \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] \\cdot V \\tag{14.11}\n\\]\n\nWe may find the current and voltage which will deliver the maximum power to the load by setting the derivative equal to zero, or \\( dP/dV = 0 \\). Using Equation (14.11), we find\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dV} = 0 = I_L - I_s \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_m}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] - I_s V_m \\left( \\frac{e}{kT} \\right) \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_m}{kT} \\right) \\tag{14.12}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V_m \\) is the voltage that produces the maximum power. We may rewrite Equation (14.12) in the form\n\n\\[\n\\left( 1 + \\frac{V_m}{V_t} \\right) \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_m}{kT} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{I_L}{I_s} \\tag{14.13}\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( V_m \\) may be determined by trial and error. Figure 14.8 shows the maximum power rectangle where \\( I_m \\) is the current when \\( V = V_m \\).\n\n*Maximum power rectangle of the solar cell I-V characteristics.*\n\n### 14.2.2 Conversion Efficiency and Solar Concentration\n\nThe conversion efficiency of a solar cell is defined as the ratio of output electrical power to incident optical power. For the maximum power output, we can write\n\n\\[\n\\eta = \\frac{P_m}{P_{in}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{I_m V_m}{P_{in}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\n(14.14)\n\nThe maximum possible current and the maximum possible voltage in the solar cell are \\(I_{sc}\\) and \\(V_{oc}\\) respectively. The ratio \\(I_m V_m / I_{sc} V_{oc}\\) is called the fill factor and is a measure of the realizable power from a solar cell. Typically, the fill factor is between 0.7 and 0.8.\n\nThe conventional pn junction solar cell has a single semiconductor bandgap energy. When the cell is exposed to the solar spectrum, a photon with energy less than \\(E_g\\) will have no effect on the electrical output power of the solar cell. A photon with energy greater than \\(E_g\\) will contribute to the solar cell output power, but the fraction of photon energy that is greater than \\(E_g\\) will eventually only be dissipated as heat. Figure 14.9 shows the solar spectral irradiance (power per unit area per unit wavelength) where air mass zero represents the solar spectrum outside the earth’s atmosphere and air mass one is the solar spectrum at the earth’s surface at noon. The maximum efficiency of a silicon pn junction solar cell is approximately 28 percent. Nonideal factors, such as series resistance and reflection from the semiconductor surface, will lower the conversion efficiency typically to the range of 10 to 15 percent.\n\nA large optical lens can be used to concentrate sunlight onto a solar cell so that the light intensity can be increased up to several hundred times. The short-circuit current increases linearly with light concentration while the open-circuit voltage increases only slightly with concentration. Figure 14.10 shows the ideal solar cell efficiency at 300 K for two values of solar concentration. We can see that the conversion efficiency increases only slightly with optical concentration. The primary advantage of using concentration techniques is to reduce the overall system cost since an optical lens is less expensive than an equivalent area of solar cells.\n\n**Figure 14.9** | Solar spectral irradiance.  \n*(From Sze [18].)*\n\n**Figure 14.10** | Ideal solar cell efficiency at \\( T = 300 \\, K \\) for \\( C = 1 \\) sun and for a \\( C = 1000 \\) sun concentrations as a function of bandgap energy.  \n*(From Sze [18].)*\n\n### 14.2.3 Nonuniform Absorption Effects\n\nWe have seen from the previous section that the photon absorption coefficient in a semiconductor is a very strong function of the incident photon energy or wavelength. Figure 14.4 shows the absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength for several semiconductor materials. As the absorption coefficient increases, more photon energy will be absorbed near the surface than deeper into the semiconductor. In this case, then, we will not have uniform excess carrier generation in a solar cell.\n\nThe number of photons absorbed per cm\\(^2\\) per second as a function of distance \\( x \\) from the surface can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\alpha \\Phi_0 e^{-\\alpha x}\n\\]\n\n(14.15)\n\nwhere \\( \\Phi_0 \\) is the incident photon flux (cm\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\)) on the surface of the semiconductor. We can also take into account the reflection of photons from the surface. Let \\( R(\\lambda) \\) be the fraction of photons that are reflected. (For bare silicon, \\( R \\approx 35 \\) percent.) If we assume that each photon absorbed creates one electron–hole pair, then the generation rate of electron–hole pairs as a function of distance \\( x \\) from the surface is\n\n\\[\nG_L = \\alpha(\\lambda) \\Phi_0(\\lambda) [1 - R(\\lambda)] e^{-\\alpha x}\n\\]\n\n(14.16)\n\nwhere each parameter may be a function of the incident wavelength. Figure 14.11 shows the excess minority carrier concentrations in this pn solar cell for two values of wavelength and for the case when \\( s = 0 \\) at the surface.\n\n**Figure 14.11** | Steady-state, photon-induced normalized minority carrier concentration in the pn junction solar cell for two values of incident photon wavelength (\\(x_i = 2 \\, \\mu m\\), \\(W = 1 \\, \\mu m\\), \\(L_s = L_e = 40 \\, \\mu m\\)).\n\n**Figure 14.12** | The energy-band diagram of a pN heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### 14.2.4 The Heterojunction Solar Cell\n\nAs we have mentioned in previous chapters, a heterojunction is formed between two semiconductors with different bandgap energies. A typical pN heterojunction energy-band diagram in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 14.12. Assume that photons are incident on the wide-bandgap material. Photons with energy less than \\(E_{gN}\\) will pass through the wide-bandgap material, which acts as an optical window, and photons with energies greater than \\(E_{gP}\\) will be absorbed in the narrow bandgap material. On the average, excess carriers created in the depletion region and within a diffusion length of the junction will be collected and will contribute to the photocurrent. Photons with an energy greater than \\(E_{gN}\\) will be absorbed in the wide-bandgap material.\n\n**Figure 14.13** | The normalized spectral response of several AlGaAs/GaAs solar cells with different compositions. (From Sze [17].)\n\nmaterial, and excess carriers generated within one diffusion length of the junction will be collected. If \\( E_{gV} \\) is large enough, then the high-energy photons will be absorbed in the space charge region of the narrow-bandgap material. This heterojunction solar cell should have better characteristics than a homojunction cell, especially at the shorter wavelengths.\n\nA variation of the heterojunction is shown in Figure 14.13. A pn homojunction is formed and then a wide-bandgap material is grown on top. Again, the wide-bandgap material acts as an optical window for photon energies \\( h\\nu < E_{gL} \\). Photons with energies \\( E_{gL} < h\\nu < E_{gH} \\) will create excess carriers in the homojunction and photons with energies \\( h\\nu > E_{gH} \\) will create excess carriers in the window type material. If the absorption coefficient in the narrow bandgap material is high, then essentially all of the excess carriers will be generated within a diffusion length of the junction, so the collection efficiency will be very high. Figure 14.13 also shows the normalized spectral response for various mole fractions \\( x \\) in the Al\\(_x\\)Ga\\(_{1-x}\\)As.\n\n### 14.2.5 Amorphous Silicon Solar Cells\n\nSingle-crystal silicon solar cells tend to be expensive and are limited to approximately 6 inches in diameter. A system powered by solar cells requires, in general,\n\nA very large area solar cell array to generate the required power. Amorphous silicon solar cells provide the possibility of fabricating large area and relatively inexpensive solar cell systems.\n\nWhen silicon is deposited by CVD techniques at temperatures below 600°C, an amorphous film is formed regardless of the type of substrate. In amorphous silicon, there is only very short range order, and no crystalline regions are observed. Hydrogen may be incorporated in the silicon to reduce the number of dangling bonds, creating a material called hydrogenated amorphous silicon.\n\nThe density of states versus energy for amorphous silicon is shown in Figure 14.14. Amorphous silicon contains large numbers of electronic energy states within the normal bandgap of single-crystal silicon. However, because of the short-range order, the effective mobility is quite small, typically in the range between \\(10^{-6}\\) and \\(10^{-3} \\, \\text{cm}^2/\\text{V-s}\\). The mobilities in the states above \\(E_c\\) and below \\(E_v\\) are between 1 and 10 \\(\\text{cm}^2/\\text{V-s}\\). Consequently, conduction through the energy states between \\(E_c\\) and \\(E_v\\) is negligible because of the low mobility. Because of the difference in mobility values, \\(E_c\\) and \\(E_v\\) are referred to as the mobility edges and the energy between \\(E_c\\) and \\(E_v\\) is referred to as the mobility gap. The mobility gap can be modified by adding specific types of impurities. Typically, the mobility gap is on the order of 1.7 eV.\n\nAmorphous silicon has a very high optical absorption coefficient, so most sunlight is absorbed within approximately \\(1 \\, \\mu m\\) of the surface. Consequently, only a\n\n\n**Figure 14.14** | Density of states versus energy of amorphous silicon.  \n(From Yang [22].)\n\n- **E**: Energy\n- **Conduction band**\n- **Valence band**\n- **Band-gap states**\n- **Mobility edges**\n- **Density of states \\(N(E)\\)**\n\n**Figure 14.15** | The (a) cross section, (b) energy-band diagram at thermal equilibrium, and (c) energy-band diagram under photon illumination of an amorphous silicon PIN solar cell.

    "text": "## 14.3 PHOTODETECTORS\n\nThere are several semiconductor devices that can be used to detect the presence of photons. These devices are known as photodetectors; they convert optical signals into electrical signals. When excess electrons and holes are generated in a semiconductor, there is an increase in the conductivity of the material. This change in conductivity is the basis of the photoconductor, perhaps the simplest type of photodetector. If electrons and holes are generated within the space charge region of a pn junction, then they will be separated by the electric field and a current will be produced. The pn junction is the basis of several photodetector devices including the photodiode and the phototransistor.\n\n### 14.3.1 Photoconductor\n\nFigure 14.16 shows a bar of semiconductor material with ohmic contacts at each end and a voltage applied between the terminals. The initial thermal-equilibrium conductivity is\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_0 = e[\\mu_n n_0 + \\mu_p p_0]\n\\]\n\n(14.17)\n\nIf excess carriers are generated in the semiconductor, the conductivity becomes\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = e[\\mu_n(n_0 + \\delta n) + \\mu_p(p_0 + \\delta p)]\n\\]\n\n(14.18)\n\nwhere \\(\\delta n\\) and \\(\\delta p\\) are the excess electron and hole concentrations, respectively. If we consider an n-type semiconductor, then, from charge neutrality, we can assume that\n\n**Figure 14.16 | A photoconductor.**\n\n\\(\\delta n = \\delta p = \\delta p\\). We will use \\(\\delta p\\) as the concentration of excess carriers. In steady state, the excess carrier concentration is given by \\(\\delta p = G \\tau_r\\), where \\(G\\) is the generation rate of excess carriers (cm\\(^{-3}\\)s\\(^{-1}\\)) and \\(\\tau_r\\) is the excess minority carrier lifetime.\n\nThe conductivity from Equation (14.18) can be rewritten as\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = e(\\mu_n n_0 + \\mu_p p_0) + e(\\delta p)(\\mu_n + \\mu_p)\n\\]\n\n(14.19)\n\nThe change in conductivity due to the optical excitation, known as the **photoconductivity**, is then\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\sigma = e(\\delta p)(\\mu_n + \\mu_p)\n\\]\n\n(14.20)\n\nAn electric field is induced in the semiconductor by the applied voltage, which produces a current. The current density can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ = (J_0 + J_L) = (\\sigma_0 + \\Delta \\sigma)E\n\\]\n\n(14.21)\n\nwhere \\(J_0\\) is the current density in the semiconductor prior to optical excitation and \\(J_L\\) is the photocurrent density. The photocurrent density is \\(J_L = \\Delta \\sigma \\cdot E\\). If the excess electrons and holes are generated uniformly throughout the semiconductor, then the photocurrent is given by\n\n\\[\nI_L = J_L \\cdot A = \\Delta \\sigma \\cdot A E = eG\\tau_r(\\mu_n + \\mu_p)AE\n\\]\n\n(14.22)\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the device. The photocurrent is directly proportional to the excess carrier generation rate, which in turn is proportional to the incident photon flux.\n\nIf excess electrons and holes are not generated uniformly throughout the semiconductor material, then the total photocurrent is found by integrating the photoconductivity over the cross-sectional area.\n\nSince \\(\\mu_n E\\) is the electron drift velocity, the electron transit time, that is, the time required for an electron to flow through the photoconductor, is\n\n\\[\nt_n = \\frac{L}{\\mu_n E}\n\\]\n\n(14.23)\n\nThe photocurrent, from Equation (14.22), can be rewritten as\n\n\\[\nI_L = eG\\tau_r \\left( \\frac{T_p}{t_n} \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n} \\right) AL\n\\]\n\n(14.24)\n\nWe may define a photoconductor gain, \\(\\Gamma_p\\), as the ratio of the rate at which charge is collected by the contacts to the rate at which charge is generated within the photoconductor. We can write the gain as\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma_p = \\frac{I_L}{eG\\tau_r AL}\n\\]\n\n(14.25)\n\nwhich, using Equation (14.24), can be written\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma_p = \\frac{T_p}{t_n} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(14.26)\n\nLet's consider physically what happens to a photon-generated electron, for example. After the excess electron is generated, it drifts very quickly out of the photoconductor at the anode terminal. In order to maintain charge neutrality throughout the photoconductor, another electron immediately enters the photoconductor at the cathode and drifts toward the anode. This process will continue during a time period equal to the mean carrier lifetime. At the end of this period, on the average, the photoelectron will recombine with a hole.\n\nThe electron transit time, using the parameters from Example 14.4, is \\( t_e = 7.41 \\times 10^{-9} \\, s \\). In a simplistic sense, the photoelectron will circulate around the photoconductor circuit 135 times during the \\( 10^{-6} \\, s \\) time duration, which is the mean carrier lifetime. If we take into account the photon-generated hole, the total number of charges collected at the photoconductor contacts for every electron generated is 183.\n\nWhen the optical signal ends, the photocurrent will decay exponentially with a time constant equal to the minority carrier lifetime. From the photoconductor gain expression, we would like a large minority carrier lifetime, but the switching speed is enhanced by a small minority carrier lifetime. There is obviously a trade-off between gain and speed. In general, the performance of a photodiode, which we will discuss next, is superior to that of a photoconductor.\n\n### 14.3.2 Photodiode\n\nA photodiode is a pn junction diode operated with an applied reverse-biased voltage. We will initially consider a long diode in which excess carriers are generated.\n\n**Figure 14.17** (a) A reverse-biased pn junction. (b) Minority carrier concentration in the reverse-biased pn junction.\n\nUniformly throughout the semiconductor device. Figure 14.17a shows the reverse-biased diode and Figure 14.17b shows the minority carrier distribution in the reverse-biased junction prior to photon illumination.\n\nLet \\( G_L \\) be the generation rate of excess carriers. The excess carriers generated within the space charge region are swept out of the depletion region very quickly by the electric field; the electrons are swept into the n region and the holes into the p region. The photon-generated current density from the space charge region is given by\n\n\\[\nJ_{L1} = e \\int G_L \\, dx\n\\]\n\n(14.27)\n\nwhere the integral is over the space charge region width. If \\( G_L \\) is constant throughout the space charge volume, then\n\n\\[\nJ_{L1} = e G_L W\n\\]\n\n(14.28)\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the space charge width. We may note that \\( J_{L1} \\) is in the reverse-biased direction through the pn junction. This component of photocurrent responds very quickly to the photon illumination and is known as the prompt photocurrent.\n\nWe may note, by comparing Equations (14.28) and (14.25), that the photodiode gain is unity. The speed of the photodiode is limited by the carrier transport through the junction.\n\nThe space charge region. If we assume that the saturation drift velocity is \\(10^7 \\, \\text{cm/s}\\) and the depletion width is \\(2 \\, \\mu\\text{m}\\), the transit time is \\(\\tau_t = 20 \\, \\text{ps}\\). The ideal modulating frequency has a period of \\(2\\tau_t\\), so the frequency is \\(f = 25 \\, \\text{GHz}\\). This frequency response is substantially higher than that of photoconductors.\n\nExcess carriers are also generated within the neutral n and p regions of the diode. The excess minority carrier electron distribution in the p region is found from the ambipolar transport equation, which is\n\n\\[\nD_n \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta n_p)}{\\partial x^2} + G_t - \\frac{\\delta n_p}{\\tau_{n0}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta n_p)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(14.29)\n\nWe will assume that the E-field is zero in the neutral regions. In steady state, \\(\\partial (\\delta n_p)/\\partial t = 0\\), so that Equation (14.29) can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 (\\delta n_p)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p}{L_n^2} = -\\frac{G_t}{D_n}\n\\]\n\n(14.30)\n\nwhere \\(L_n^2 = D_n \\tau_{n0}\\).\n\nThe solution to Equation (14.30) can be found as the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found from the equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 (\\delta n_{ph})}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_{ph}}{L_n^2} = 0\n\\]\n\n(14.31)\n\nwhere \\(\\delta n_{ph}\\) is the homogeneous solution and is given by\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{ph} = Ae^{-x/L_n} + Be^{x/L_n}, \\quad (x \\geq 0)\n\\]\n\n(14.32)\n\nOne boundary condition is that \\(\\delta n_{ph}\\) must remain finite, which implies that \\(B = 0\\) for the \"long\" diode.\n\nThe particular solution is found from\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\delta n_{pp}}{L_n^2} = -\\frac{G_t}{D_n}\n\\]\n\n(14.33)\n\nwhich yields\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{pp} = \\frac{G_t L_n^2}{D_n} = \\frac{G_t (D_n \\tau_{n0})}{D_n} = G_t \\tau_{n0}\n\\]\n\n(14.34)\n\nThe total steady-state solution for the excess minority carrier electron concentration in the p region is then\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_p = Ae^{-x/L_n} + G_t \\tau_{n0}\n\\]\n\n(14.35)\n\nThe total electron concentration is zero at \\(x = 0\\) for the reverse-biased junction. The excess electron concentration \\(x = 0\\) is then\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_p (x = 0) = -n_{p0}\n\\]\n\n(14.36)\n\nUsing the boundary condition from Equation (14.36), the electron concentration given by Equation (14.35) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_p = G_t \\tau_{n0} - (G_t \\tau_{n0} + n_{p0}) e^{-x/L_n}\n\\]\n\n(14.37)\n\n**Figure 14.18** | Steady-state, photoinduced minority carrier concentrations and photocurrents in a “long” reverse-biased pn junction.\n\nWe can find the excess minority carrier hole concentration in the n region using the same type of analysis. Using the \\( x' \\) notation shown in Figure 14.17, we can write\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_n = G_T \\tau_{p0} - (G_T \\tau_{p0} + p_{n0}) e^{-x'/L_n}\n\\]\n\n(14.38)\n\nEquations (14.37) and (14.38) are plotted in Figure 14.18. We may note that the steady-state values far from the space charge region are the same as were given previously.\n\nThe gradient in the minority carrier concentrations will produce diffusion currents in the pn junction. The diffusion current density at \\( x = 0 \\) due to minority carrier electrons is\n\n\\[\nJ_{n1} = eD_n \\left( \\frac{d(\\delta n_p)}{dx} \\right)_{x=0} = eD_n \\frac{d}{dx} [G_T \\tau_{n0} - (G_T \\tau_{n0} + n_{p0}) e^{-x/L_n}]_{x=0}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{eD_n}{L_n} (G_T \\tau_{n0} + n_{p0})\n\\]\n\n(14.39)\n\nEquation (14.39) can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_{n1} = eG_T L_n + \\frac{eD_n n_{p0}}{L_n}\n\\]\n\n(14.40)\n\nThe first term in Equation (14.40) is the steady-state photocurrent density while the second term is the ideal reverse saturation current density due to the minority carrier electrons.\n\nThe diffusion current density (in the x direction) at \\( x' = 0 \\) due to the minority carrier holes is\n\n\\[\nJ_{p1} = eG_T L_p + \\frac{eD_p p_{n0}}{L_p}\n\\]\n\n(14.41)\n\nSimilarly, the first term is the steady-state photocurrent density and the second term is the ideal reverse saturation current density.\n\nThe total steady-state diode photocurrent density for the long diode is now\n\n\\[\nJ_L = eG_LW + eG_LL_n + eG_LL_p = e(W + L_n + L_p)G_L\n\\]\n\n(14.42)\n\nAgain note that the photocurrent is in the reverse-biased direction through the diode. The photocurrent given by Equation (14.42) is the result of assuming uniform generation of excess carriers throughout the structure, a long diode, and steady state.\n\nThe time response of the diffusion components of the photocurrent is relatively slow, since these currents are the results of the diffusion of minority carriers toward the depletion region. The diffusion components of photocurrent are referred to as the delayed photocurrent.\n\nIn this example calculation, \\( L_n \\gg W \\) and \\( L_p \\gg W \\). In many pn junction structures, the assumption of a long diode will not be valid, so the photocurrent expression will have to be modified. In addition, the photon energy absorption may not be uniform throughout the pn structure. The effect of nonuniform absorption will be considered in the next section.\n\n### 14.3.3 PIN Photodiode\n\nIn many photodetector applications, the speed of response is important; therefore, the prompt photocurrent generated in the space charge region is the only photocurrent of interest. To increase the photodetector sensitivity, the depletion region width should be made as large as possible. This can be achieved in a PIN photodiode.\n\nThe PIN diode consists of a p region and an n region separated by an intrinsic region. A sketch of a PIN diode is shown in Figure 14.19a. The intrinsic region width \\( W \\) is much larger than the space charge width of a normal pn junction. If a reverse bias is applied to the PIN diode, the space charge region extends completely through the intrinsic region.\n\n**Figure 14.19** (a) A reverse-biased PIN photodiode. (b) Geometry showing nonuniform photon absorption.\n\nAssume that a photon flux \\(\\Phi_0\\) is incident on the \\(p^+\\) region. If we assume that the \\(p^+\\) region width \\(W_p\\) is very thin, then the photon flux, as a function of distance, in the intrinsic region is \\(\\Phi(x) = \\Phi_0 e^{-\\alpha x}\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the photon absorption coefficient. This nonlinear photon absorption is shown in Figure 14.19b. The photocurrent density generated in the intrinsic region can be found as\n\n\\[\nJ_L = e \\int_0^W G_L \\, dx = e \\int_0^W \\Phi_0 e^{-\\alpha x} \\, dx = e \\Phi_0 (1 - e^{-\\alpha W})\n\\]\n\n(14.43)\n\nThis equation assumes that there is no electron–hole recombination within the space charge region and also that each photon absorbed creates one electron–hole pair.\n\nIn most situations, we will not have a long diode; thus, the steady-state photocurrent described by Equation (14.42) will not apply for most photodiodes.\n\n### 14.3.4 Avalanche Photodiode\n\nThe avalanche photodiode is similar to the pn or PIN photodiode except that the bias applied to the avalanche photodiode is sufficiently large to cause impact ionization.\n\nElectron–hole pairs are generated in the space charge region by photon absorption, as we have discussed previously. The photon-generated electrons and holes now generate additional electron–hole pairs through impact ionization. The avalanche photodiode now has a current gain introduced by the avalanche multiplication factor.\n\nThe electron–hole pairs generated by photon absorption and by impact ionization are swept out of the space charge region very quickly. If the saturation velocity is \\(10^7 \\, \\text{cm/s}\\) in a depletion region that is \\(10 \\, \\mu\\text{m}\\) wide, then the transit time is\n\n\\[\n\\tau_t = \\frac{10^7}{10 \\times 10^4} = 100 \\, \\text{ps}\n\\]\n\nThe period of a modulation signal would be \\(2\\pi \\tau_t\\), so that the frequency would be\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_t} = \\frac{1}{200 \\times 10^{-12}} = 5 \\, \\text{GHz}\n\\]\n\nIf the avalanche photodiode current gain is 20, then the gain-bandwidth product is 100 GHz. The avalanche photodiode could respond to light waves modulated at microwave frequencies.\n\n### 14.3.5 Phototransistor\n\nA bipolar transistor can also be used as a photodetector. The phototransistor can have high gain through the transistor action. An npn bipolar phototransistor is shown in Figure 14.20a. This device has a large base–collector junction area and is usually operated with the base open circuited. Figure 14.20b shows the block diagram of the phototransistor. Electrons and holes generated in the reverse-biased B–C junction are swept out of the space charge region, producing a photocurrent \\(I_L\\). Holes are swept\n\n\n**Figure 14.20** (a) A bipolar phototransistor. (b) Block diagram of the open-base phototransistor.",

Since the B–E becomes forward-biased, electrons will be injected from the emitter back into the base, leading to the normal transistor action.\n\nFrom Figure 14.20b, we see that\n\n\\[\nI_E = \\alpha I_C + I_L\n\\]\n\n(14.44)\n\nwhere \\( I_L \\) is the photon-generated current and \\( \\alpha \\) is the common base current gain. Since the base is an open circuit, we have \\( I_C = I_E \\), so Equation (14.44) can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\alpha I_C + I_L\n\\]\n\n(14.45)\n\nSolving for \\( I_C \\), we find\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\frac{I_L}{1 - \\alpha}\n\\]\n\n(14.46)\n\nRelating \\( \\alpha \\) to \\( \\beta \\), the dc common emitter current gain, Equation (14.46) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_C = (1 + \\beta) I_L\n\\]\n\n(14.47)\n\nEquation (14.47) shows that the basic B–C photocurrent is multiplied by the factor \\((1 + \\beta)\\). The phototransistor, then, amplifies the basic photocurrent.\n\nWith the relatively large B–C junction area, the frequency response of the phototransistor is limited by the B–C junction capacitance. Since the base is essentially the input to the device, the large B–C capacitance is multiplied by the Miller effect, so the frequency response of the phototransistor is further reduced. The phototransistor, however, is a lower-noise device than the avalanche photodiode.\n\nPhototransistors can also be fabricated in heterostructures. The injection efficiency is increased as a result of the bandgap differences, as we discussed in Chapter 12. With the bandgap difference, the lightly doped base restriction no longer applies. A fairly heavily doped, narrow-base device can be fabricated with a high blocking voltage and a high gain.\n\nIn the first section of this chapter, we have discussed the creation of excess electron–hole pairs by photon absorption. Eventually, excess electrons and holes recombine, and in direct bandgap materials the recombination process may result in the emission of a photon. The general property of light emission is referred to as luminescence.\n\nWhen excess electrons and holes are created by photon absorption, photon emission from the recombination process is called photoluminescence.\n\nElectroluminescence is the process of generating photon emission when the excitation of excess carriers is a result of an electric current caused by an applied electric field. We are mainly concerned here with injection electroluminescence, the result of injecting carriers across a pn junction. The light emitting diode and the pn junction laser diode are examples of this phenomenon. In these devices, electric energy, in the form of a current, is converted directly into photon energy.\n\n### 14.4.1 Basic Transitions\n\nOnce electron-hole pairs are formed, there are several possible processes by which the electrons and holes can recombine. Some recombination processes may result in photon emission from direct bandgap materials, whereas other recombination processes in the same material may not.\n\nFigure 14.21a shows the basic interband transitions. Curve (i) corresponds to an intrinsic emission very close to the bandgap energy of the material. Curves (ii) and (iii) correspond to energetic electrons or holes. If either of these recombinations result in the emission of a photon, the energy of the emitted photon will be slightly larger than the bandgap energy. There will then be an emission spectrum and a bandwidth associated with the emission.\n\nThe possible recombination processes involving impurity or defect states are shown in Figure 14.21b. Curve (i) is the conduction band to acceptor transition, curve (ii) is the donor to valence-band transition, curve (iii) is the donor to acceptor transition, and curve (iv) is the recombination due to a deep trap. Curve (iv) is a nonradiative process corresponding to the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination process discussed in Chapter 6. The other recombination processes may or may not result in the emission of a photon.\n\nFigure 14.21c shows the Auger recombination process, which can become important in direct bandgap materials with high doping concentrations. The Auger recombination process is a nonradiative process. The Auger recombination, in one case, shown in curve (i), is a recombination between an electron and hole, accompanied by the transfer of energy to another free hole. Similarly, in the second case, the recombination between an electron and hole can result in the transfer of energy to a free electron as shown in curve (ii). The third particle involved in this process will eventually lose its energy to the lattice in the form of heat. The process involving two holes and an electron would occur predominantly in heavily doped p-type materials, and the process involving two electrons and a hole would occur primarily in a heavily doped n-type material.\n\nThe recombination processes shown in Figure 14.21a indicate that the emission of a photon is not necessarily at a single, discrete energy, but can occur over a range of energies. The spontaneous emission rate generally has the form\n\n\\[\nI(\\nu) \\propto \\nu^2 (h\\nu - E_g)^{1/2} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(h\\nu - E_g)}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(14.48)\n\nwhere \\( E_g \\) is the bandgap energy. Figure 14.22 shows the emission spectra from gallium arsenide. The peak photon energy decreases with temperature because the...\n\n**Figure 14.21** | Basic transitions in a semiconductor.\n\n**Figure 14.22** | GaAs diode emission spectra at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) and \\( T = 77 \\, \\text{K} \\).  \n*(From Sze and Ng [17])*\n\nThe bandgap energy decreases with temperature. We will show that the bandwidth of the emission spectra can be greatly reduced in a laser diode by using an optical resonator.\n\n### 14.4.2 Luminescent Efficiency\n\nWe have shown that not all recombination processes are radiative. An efficient luminescent material is one in which radiative transitions predominate. The quantum efficiency is defined as the ratio of the radiative recombination rate to the total recombination rate for all processes. We can write\n\n\\[\n\\eta_q = \\frac{R_r}{R}\n\\]\n\n(14.49)\n\nwhere \\( \\eta_q \\) is the quantum efficiency, \\( R_r \\) is the radiative recombination rate, and \\( R \\) is the total recombination rate of the excess carriers. Since the recombination rate is\n\nInversely proportional to lifetime, we can write the quantum efficiency in terms of lifetimes as\n\n\\[\n\\eta_q = \\frac{\\tau_{nr}}{\\tau_{nr} + \\tau_r}\n\\]\n\n(14.50)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau_{nr}\\) is the nonradiative lifetime and \\(\\tau_r\\) is the radiative lifetime. For a high luminescent efficiency, the nonradiative lifetimes must be large; thus, the probability of a nonradiative recombination is small compared to the radiative recombination.\n\nThe interband recombination rate of electrons and holes will be directly proportional to the number of electrons available and directly proportional to the number of available empty states (holes). We can write\n\n\\[\nR = Bnp\n\\]\n\n(14.51)\n\nwhere \\(R\\) is the band-to-band radiative recombination rate and \\(B\\) is the constant of proportionality. The values of \\(B\\) for direct-bandgap materials are on the order of \\(10^6\\) larger than for indirect bandgap materials. The probability of a direct band-to-band radiative recombination transition in an indirect bandgap material is very unlikely.\n\nOne problem encountered with the emission of photons from a direct bandgap material is the reabsorption of the emitted photons. In general, the emitted photons will have energies \\(h\\nu > E_p\\), which means that the absorption coefficient is not zero for this energy. In order to generate a light output from a light emitting device, the process must take place near the surface. One possible solution to the reabsorption problem is to use heterojunction devices. These are discussed in later sections.\n\n### 14.4.3 Materials\n\nAn important direct bandgap semiconductor material for optical devices is gallium arsenide. Another compound material that is of great interest is Al\\(_x\\)Ga\\(_{1-x}\\)As. This material is a compound semiconductor in which the ratio of aluminum atoms to gallium atoms can be varied to achieve specific characteristics. Figure 14.23 shows the bandgap energy as a function of the mole fraction between aluminum and gallium. We can note from the figure that for \\(0 < x < 0.45\\), the alloy material is a direct bandgap material. For \\(x > 0.45\\), the material becomes an indirect bandgap material, not suitable for optical devices. For \\(0 < x < 0.35\\), the bandgap energy can be expressed as\n\n\\[\nE_g = 1.424 + 1.247x \\, \\text{eV}\n\\]\n\n(14.52)\n\nAnother compound semiconductor used for optical devices is the GaAs\\(_{1-x}\\)P\\(_x\\) system.

    "text": "## 14.5 LIGHT EMITTING DIODES\n\nPhotodetectors and solar cells convert optical energy into electrical energy—the photons generate excess electrons and holes, which produce an electric current. We might also apply a voltage across a pn junction resulting in a diode current, which in turn can produce photons and a light output. This inverse mechanism is called injection electroluminescence. This device is known as a Light Emitting Diode (LED). The spectral output of an LED may have a relatively wide wavelength bandwidth of between 30 and 40 nm. However, this emission spectrum is narrow enough so that a particular color is observed, provided the output is in the visible range.\n\n### 14.5.1 Generation of Light\n\nAs we have discussed previously, photons may be emitted if an electron and hole recombine by a direct band-to-band recombination process in a direct bandgap material. The emission wavelength, from Equation (14.1), is\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E_g} = \\frac{1.24}{E_g} \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\quad (14.53)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( E_g \\) is the bandgap energy measured in electron-volts.\n\nWhen a voltage is applied across a pn junction, electrons and holes are injected across the space charge region where they become excess minority carriers. These excess minority carriers diffuse into the neutral semiconductor regions where they recombine with majority carriers. If this recombination process is a direct band-to-band process, photons are emitted. The diode diffusion current is directly proportional to the recombination rate, so the output photon intensity will also be proportional to the ideal diode diffusion current. In gallium arsenide, electroluminescence originates primarily on the p side of the junction because the efficiency for electron injection is higher than that for hole injection.\n\n### 14.5.2 Internal Quantum Efficiency\n\nThe **internal quantum efficiency** of an LED is the fraction of diode current that produces luminescence. The internal quantum efficiency is a function of the injection efficiency and a function of the percentage of radiative recombination events compared with the total number of recombination events.\n\nThe three current components in a forward-biased diode are the minority carrier electron diffusion current, the minority carrier hole diffusion current, and the space charge recombination current. These current densities can be written, respectively, as\n\n\\[\nJ_n = \\frac{eD_n n_{p0}}{L_n} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV}{kT}\\right) - 1 \\right] \\tag{14.54a}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nJ_p = \\frac{eD_p p_{n0}}{L_p} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV}{kT}\\right) - 1 \\right] \\tag{14.54b}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nJ_r = \\frac{en_i W}{2\\tau_0} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV}{2kT}\\right) - 1 \\right] \\tag{14.54c}\n\\]\n\nThe recombination of electrons and holes within the space charge region is, in general, through traps near midgap and is a nonradiative process. Since luminescence is due primarily to the recombination of minority carrier electrons in GaAs, we can define an injection efficiency as the fraction of electron current to total current. Then\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{J_n}{J_n + J_p + J_r} \\tag{14.55}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the injection efficiency. We can make \\(\\gamma\\) approach unity by using an n\\(^+\\)p diode so that \\(J_p\\) is a small fraction of the diode current and by forward biasing the diode sufficiently so that \\(J_r\\) is a small fraction of the total diode current.\n\nOnce the electrons are injected into the p region, not all electrons will recombine radiatively. We can define the radiative and nonradiative recombination rates as\n\n\\[\nR_r = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau_r} \\tag{14.56a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nR_{nr} = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau_{nr}}\n\\]\n\n(14.56b)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau_r\\) and \\(\\tau_{nr}\\) are the radiative and nonradiative recombination lifetimes, respectively, and \\(\\delta n\\) is the excess carrier concentration. The total recombination rate is\n\n\\[\nR = R_r + R_{nr} = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau_r} + \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau_{nr}}\n\\]\n\n(14.57)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) is the net excess carrier lifetime.\n\nThe radiative efficiency is defined as the fraction of recombinations that are radiative. We can write\n\n\\[\n\\eta = \\frac{R_r}{R_r + R_{nr}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_r} + \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{nr}}} = \\frac{\\tau_r}{\\tau}\n\\]\n\n(14.58)\n\nwhere \\(\\eta\\) is the radiative efficiency. The nonradiative recombination rate is proportional to \\(N_t\\), which is the density of nonradiative trapping sites within the forbidden bandgap. Obviously, the radiative efficiency increases as \\(N_t\\) is reduced.\n\nThe internal quantum efficiency is now written as\n\n\\[\n\\eta_i = \\eta \\eta\n\\]\n\n(14.59)\n\nThe radiative recombination rate is proportional to the p-type doping. As the p-type doping increases, the radiative recombination rate increases. However, the injection efficiency decreases as the p-type doping increases; therefore, there is an optimum doping that maximizes the internal quantum efficiency.\n\n### 14.5.3 External Quantum Efficiency\n\nOne very important parameter of the LED is the **external quantum efficiency**: the fraction of generated photons that are actually emitted from the semiconductor. The external quantum efficiency is normally a much smaller number than the internal quantum efficiency. Once a photon has been produced in the semiconductor, there are three loss mechanisms the photon may encounter: photon absorption within the semiconductor, Fresnel loss, and critical angle loss.\n\nFigure 14.25 shows a pn junction LED. Photons can be emitted in any direction. Since the emitted photon energy must be \\(h\\nu \\geq E_g\\), these emitted photons can be reabsorbed within the semiconductor material. The majority of photons will actually be emitted away from the surface and reabsorbed in the semiconductor.\n\nPhotons must be emitted from the semiconductor into air; thus, the photons must be transmitted across a dielectric interface. Figure 14.26 shows the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. The parameter \\(n_2\\) is the index of refraction for the semiconductor and \\(n_1\\) is the index of refraction for air. The reflection coefficient is\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\left( \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_2 + n_1} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n(14.60)\n\nThis effect is called Fresnel loss. The reflection coefficient \\(\\Gamma\\) is the fraction of incident photons that are reflected back into the semiconductor.\n\n**Figure 14.25** | Schematic of photon emission at the pn junction of an LED.\n\n**Figure 14.26** | Schematic of incident, reflected, and transmitted photons at a dielectric interface.",

Gallium arsenide, a direct bandgap material, has a bandgap energy of \\( E_g = 1.42 \\, \\text{eV} \\), which yields a wavelength of \\( \\lambda = 0.873 \\, \\mu m \\).

    "text": "## 14.6 LASER DIODES\n\nThe photon output of the LED is due to an electron giving up energy as it makes a transition from the conduction band to the valence band. The LED photon emission is spontaneous in that each band-to-band transition is an independent event. The spontaneous emission process yields a spectral output of the LED with a fairly wide bandwidth. If the structure and operating condition of the LED are modified, the device can operate in a new mode, producing a coherent spectral output with a bandwidth of wavelengths less than 0.1 nm. This new device is a laser diode, where laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Although there are many different types of lasers, we are here concerned only with the pn junction laser diode.\n\n### 14.6.1 Stimulated Emission and Population Inversion\n\nFigure 14.31a shows the case when an incident photon is absorbed and an electron is elevated from an energy state \\( E_1 \\) to an energy state \\( E_2 \\). This process is known as induced absorption. If the electron spontaneously makes the transition back to the lower energy level with a photon being emitted, we have a spontaneous emission process as indicated in Figure 14.31b. On the other hand, if there is an incident photon at a time when an electron is in the higher energy state as shown in Figure 14.31c, the incident photon can interact with the electron, causing the electron to make a transition downward. The downward transition produces a photon. Since this process was initiated by the incident photon, the process is called **stimulated or induced emission**. Note that this stimulated emission process has produced two photons; thus, we can have optical gain or amplification. The two emitted photons are in phase so that the spectral output will be coherent.\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, the electron distribution in a semiconductor is determined by the Fermi–Dirac statistics. If the Boltzmann approximation applies, then we can write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\exp \\left[ -\\frac{(E_2 - E_1)}{kT} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(14.62)\n\nwhere \\( N_1 \\) and \\( N_2 \\) are the electron concentrations in the energy levels \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), respectively, and where \\( E_2 > E_1 \\). In thermal equilibrium, \\( N_2 < N_1 \\). The probability of an induced absorption event is exactly the same as that of an induced emission event. The number of photons absorbed is proportional to \\( N_1 \\) and the number of additional photons emitted is proportional to \\( N_2 \\). In order to achieve optical amplification or for lasing action to occur, we must have \\( N_2 > N_1 \\); this is called population inversion. We cannot achieve lasing action at thermal equilibrium.\n\n\n**Figure 14.31** | Schematic diagram showing (a) induced absorption, (b) spontaneous emission, and (c) stimulated emission processes.\n\n- **(a)** Induced absorption\n- **(b)** Spontaneous emission\n- **(c)** Stimulated or induced emission\n\n- \\( E_2 \\)\n- \\( E_1 \\)\n- \\( h\\nu \\)\n\n\n*Light propagating in z direction through a material with two energy levels.*\n\nFigure 14.32 shows the two energy levels with a light wave at an intensity \\( I_\\nu \\) propagating in the \\( z \\) direction. The change in intensity as a function of \\( z \\) can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dI_\\nu}{dz} \\propto \\frac{\\# \\text{ photons emitted} - \\# \\text{ photons absorbed}}{\\text{cm}^3}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dI_\\nu}{dz} = N_2 W_i \\cdot h\\nu - N_1 W_i \\cdot h\\nu \\tag{14.63}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( W_i \\) is the induced transition probability. Equation (14.63) assumes no loss mechanisms and neglects the spontaneous transitions.\n\nEquation (14.63) can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dI_\\nu}{dz} = \\gamma(\\nu)I_\\nu \\tag{14.64}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma(\\nu) \\propto (N_2 - N_1) \\) and is the amplification factor.

Figure 14.33a shows the energy-band diagram of a degenerately doped pn junction in thermal equilibrium. The Fermi level is in the conduction band in the n-region and the Fermi level is in the valence band in the p region. Figure 14.33b shows the energy bands of the pn junction when a forward bias is applied. The gain factor in a pn homojunction diode is given by\n\n\\[\n\\gamma(\\nu) \\propto \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{h\\nu - (E_{Fn} - E_{Fp})}{kT}\\right) \\right] \\tag{14.66}\n\\]\n\nIn order for \\( \\gamma(\\nu) > 1 \\), we must have \\( h\\nu < (E_{Fn} - E_{Fp}) \\), which implies that the junction must be degenerately doped since we also have the requirement that \\( h\\nu \\geq E_g \\). In the vicinity of the junction, there is a region in which population inversion occurs. There are large numbers of electrons in the conduction band directly above a large number of empty states. If band-to-band recombination occurs, photons will be emitted with energies in the range \\( E_g < h\\nu < (E_{Fn} - E_{Fp}) \\).\n\n**Figure 14.33** (a) Degenerately doped pn junction at zero bias. (b) Degenerately doped pn junction under forward bias with photon emission.\n\n\n**Figure 14.34** A pn junction laser diode with cleaved (110) planes forming the Fabry-Perot cavity. (After Yang [22].)\n\n### 14.6.2 Optical Cavity\n\nPopulation inversion is one requirement for lasing action to occur. Coherent emission output is achieved by using an optical cavity. The cavity will cause a buildup of the optical intensity from positive feedback. A resonant cavity consisting of two parallel mirrors is known as a Fabry–Perot resonator. The resonant cavity can be fabricated, for example, by cleaving a gallium arsenide crystal along the (110) planes as shown in Figure 14.34. The optical wave propagates through the junction in the z direction, bouncing back and forth between the end mirrors. The mirrors are actually only partially reflecting so that a portion of the optical wave will be transmitted out of the junction.\n\nFor resonance, the length of the cavity \\( L \\) must be an integral number of half wavelengths, or\n\n\\[\nN \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\right) = L\n\\]\n\n(14.67)\n\nwhere \\( N \\) is an integer. Since \\( \\lambda \\) is small and \\( L \\) is relatively large, there can be many resonant modes in the cavity. Figure 14.35a shows the resonant modes as a function of wavelength.\n\n**Figure 14.35** | Schematic diagram showing (a) resonant modes of a cavity with length \\( L \\), (b) spontaneous emission curve, and (c) actual emission modes of a laser diode.  \n(After Yang [22].)\n\nWhen a forward-bias current is applied to the pn junction, spontaneous emission will initially occur. The spontaneous emission spectrum is relatively broadband and is superimposed on the possible lasing modes as shown in Figure 14.35b. In order for lasing to be initiated, the spontaneous emission gain must be larger than the optical losses. By positive feedback in the cavity, lasing can occur at several specific wavelengths as indicated in Figure 14.35c.\n\n### 14.6.3 Threshold Current\n\nThe optical intensity in the device can be written from Equation (14.65) as\n\n\\[\nI_{\\nu} \\propto e^{\\gamma(\\nu)x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma(\\nu)\\) is the amplification factor. We have two basic loss mechanisms. The first is the photon absorption in the semiconductor material. We can write\n\n\\[\nI_{\\nu} \\propto e^{-\\alpha(\\nu)x} \\tag{14.68}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha(\\nu)\\) is the absorption coefficient. The second loss mechanism is due to the partial transmission of the optical signal through the ends, or through the partially reflecting mirrors.\n\nAt the onset of lasing, which is known as threshold, the optical loss of one round trip through the cavity is just offset by the optical gain. The threshold condition is then expressed as\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma \\Gamma_1 \\Gamma_2 \\exp\\left[ (2\\gamma(\\nu) - 2\\alpha(\\nu))L \\right] = 1\n\\]\n\n(14.69)\n\nwhere \\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\) are the reflectivity coefficients of the two end mirrors. For the case when the optical mirrors are cleaved (110) surfaces of gallium arsenide, the reflectivity coefficients are given approximately by\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2 = \\left( \\frac{\\bar{n} - \\bar{n}_i}{\\bar{n} + \\bar{n}_i} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n(14.70)\n\nwhere \\(\\bar{n}\\) and \\(\\bar{n}_i\\) are the index of refraction parameters for the semiconductor and air, respectively. The parameter \\(\\gamma(\\nu)\\) is the optical gain at threshold.\n\nThe optical gain at threshold, \\(\\gamma(\\nu)\\), may be determined from Equation (14.69) as\n\n\\[\n\\gamma(\\nu) = \\alpha + \\frac{1}{2L} \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma_1 \\Gamma_2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(14.71)\n\nSince the optical gain is a function of the pn junction current, we can define a threshold current density as\n\n\\[\nJ_{th} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left[ \\alpha + \\frac{1}{2L} \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma_1 \\Gamma_2} \\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n(14.72)\n\nwhere \\(\\beta\\) can be determined theoretically or experimentally. Figure 14.36 shows the threshold current density as a function of the mirror losses. We may note the relatively high threshold current density for a pn junction laser diode.\n\n**Figure 14.36** | Threshold current density of a laser diode as a function of Fabry-Perot cavity end losses.  \n*(After Yang [22].)*\n\n**Table**: Threshold Current Density\n\n| \\( \\frac{1}{2L} \\ln \\frac{1}{\\Gamma_1 \\Gamma_2} \\) (cm\\(^{-1}\\)) | \\( J_{th} \\) (A/cm\\(^2\\)) |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n| 0                                                               | 0                         |\n| 10                                                              | 500                       |\n| 20                                                              | 1000                      |\n| 30                                                              | 1500                      |\n| 40                                                              | 2000                      |\n| 50                                                              | 2500                      |\n| 60                                                              | 3000                      |\n| 70                                                              | 3500                      |\n\n- \\(\\bar{\\alpha} = 15 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}\\)\n- \\(\\bar{\\beta} = 2.1 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{cm/A}\\)\n\n### 14.6.4 Device Structures and Characteristics\n\nWe have seen that in a homojunction LED, the photons may be emitted in any direction, which lowers the external quantum efficiency. Significant improvement in device characteristics can be made if the emitted photons are confined to a region near the junction. This confinement can be achieved by using an optical dielectric waveguide. The basic device is a three-layered, double heterojunction structure known as a double heterojunction laser. A requirement for a dielectric waveguide is that the index of refraction of the center material be larger than that of the other two dielectrics. Figure 14.37 shows the index of refraction for the AlGaAs system. We may note that GaAs has the highest index of refraction.\n\nAn example of a double heterojunction laser is shown in Figure 14.38a. A thin p-GaAs layer is between P-AlGaAs and N-AlGaAs layers. A simplified energy-band diagram is shown in Figure 14.38b for the forward-biased diode. Electrons are injected from the N-AlGaAs into the p-GaAs. Population inversion is easily obtained since the conduction band potential barrier prevents the electrons from diffusing into the P-AlGaAs region. Radiative recombination is then confined to the p-GaAs region. Since the index of refraction of GaAs is larger than that of AlGaAs, the light wave is also confined to the GaAs region. An optical cavity can be formed by cleaving the semiconductor perpendicular to the N-AlGaAs–p-GaAs junction.\n\n\n**Figure 14.37** Index of refraction of Al\\(_x\\)Ga\\(_{1-x}\\)As as a function of mole fraction \\(x\\).  \n*(From Sze [18].)*\n\nGraph Details\n\n- **X-axis**: Mole fraction AlAs, \\(x\\)\n  - Range: 0 (GaAs) to 1.0 (AlAs)\n- **Y-axis**: Refractive index, \\(n\\)\n  - Range: 2.9 to 3.6\n- **Line**: \\(h\\nu = 1.38 \\, \\text{eV}\\), \\(T = 297 \\, \\text{K}\\)\n\n\n**Figure 14.38** (a) Basic double heterojunction structure.

The threshold current is defined to be the current at the breakpoint. At low currents, the output spectrum is very wide and is the result of the spontaneous transitions. When the diode current is slightly above the threshold value, the various resonant frequencies are observed. When the diode current becomes large, a single dominant mode with a narrow bandwidth is produced.\n\nThe performance of the laser diode can be further improved if a very narrow recombination region is used with a somewhat wider optical waveguide.

A few of these devices have been discussed and analyzed in this chapter.\n- The photon absorption process has been discussed and the absorption coefficient data for semiconductors has been presented.\n- Solar cells convert optical power into electrical power. The simple pn junction solar cell was initially considered. The short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power were considered.\n- Heterojunction and amorphous silicon solar cells were also considered. Heterojunction cells can be fabricated that tend to increase the conversion efficiency and produce relatively large open-circuit voltages. Amorphous silicon offers the possibility of low-cost, large-area solar cell arrays.\n- Photodetectors are semiconductor devices that convert optical signals into electrical signals. The photoconductor is perhaps the simplest type of photodetector. The change in conductivity of the semiconductor due to the creation of excess electrons and holes by the incident photons is the basis of this device.\n- Photodiodes are diodes that have reverse-biased voltages applied. Excess carriers that are created by incident photons in the space-charge region are swept out by the electric field creating a photocurrent. The photocurrent is directly proportional to the incident photon intensity. PIN and avalanche photodiodes are variations of the basic photodiode.\n- The photocurrent generated in a phototransistor is multiplied by the transistor gain. However, the time response of the phototransistor may be slower than that of a photodiode because of the Miller effect and Miller capacitance.\n- The inverse mechanism of photon absorption in a pn junction is injection electroluminescence. The recombination of excess electrons and holes in a direct bandgap semiconductor can result in the emission of photons.\n- The light emitting diodes (LEDs) are the class of pn junction diodes whose photon output is a result of spontaneous recombinations of excess electrons and holes. A fairly wide bandwidth in the output signal, on the order of 30 nm, is a result of the spontaneous process.\n- The output of a laser diode is the result of stimulated emission. An optical cavity, or Fabry–Perot resonator, is used in conjunction with a diode so that the photon output is in phase, or coherent. Multilayered heterojunction structures can be fabricated to improve the laser diode characteristics.",

    "text": "## 5.1 CARRIER DRIFT\n\nAn electric field applied to a semiconductor will produce a force on electrons and holes so that they will experience a net acceleration and net movement, provided there are available energy states in the conduction and valence bands. This net movement of charge due to an electric field is called **drift**. The net drift of charge gives rise to a **drift current**.\n\n### 5.1.1 Drift Current Density\n\nIf we have a **positive volume charge density** \\( \\rho \\) moving at an **average drift velocity** \\( v_d \\), the **drift current density** is given by\n\n\\[\nJ_{dr} = \\rho v_d\n\\]\n\n(5.1a)\n\nIn terms of units, we have\n\n\\[\nJ_{dr} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Coul}}{\\text{cm}^3} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\text{cm}}{\\text{s}} \\right) = \\frac{\\text{Coul}}{\\text{cm}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}} = \\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{cm}^2}\n\\]\n\n(5.1b)\n\nIf the **volume charge density is due to positively charged holes**, then\n\n\\[\nJ_{pdr} = (eP)v_{dp}\n\\]\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere \\( J_{pdr} \\) is the drift current density due to holes and \\( v_{dp} \\) is the average drift velocity of the holes.\n\nThe equation of motion of a positively charged hole in the presence of an electric field is\n\n\\[\nF = m_p^* a = eE\n\\]\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere \\( e \\) is the magnitude of the electronic charge, \\( a \\) is the acceleration, \\( E \\) is the electric field, and \\( m_p^* \\) is the conductivity effective mass of the hole. If the electric field is constant, then we expect the velocity to increase linearly with time. However, charged particles in a semiconductor are involved in collisions with ionized impurity atoms and with thermally vibrating lattice atoms. These collisions, or scattering events, alter the velocity characteristics of the particle.\n\nAs the hole accelerates in a crystal due to the electric field, the velocity increases. When the charged particle collides with an atom in the crystal, for example, the particle loses most, or all, of its energy. The particle will again begin to accelerate and gain energy until it is again involved in a scattering process. This continues over and over again. Throughout this process, the particle will gain an average drift velocity which, for low electric fields, is directly proportional to the electric field. We may then write\n\n\\[\nv_{dp} = \\mu_p E\n\\]\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere \\( \\mu_p \\) is the proportionality factor and is called the **hole mobility**. The mobility is an important parameter of the semiconductor since it describes how well a particle can move through the material.\n\n*The conductivity effective mass is used when carriers are in motion. See Appendix F for further discussion of effective mass concepts.*\n\n\n**Table 5.1**: Typical mobility values at \\( T = 300 \\, K \\) and low doping concentrations\n\n| Material          | \\(\\mu_n\\) (cm\\(^2\\)/V·s) | \\(\\mu_p\\) (cm\\(^2\\)/V·s) |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Silicon           | 1350                     | 480                      |\n| Gallium arsenide  | 8500                     | 400                      |\n| Germanium         | 3900                     | 1900                     |\n\nThe unit of mobility is usually expressed in terms of cm\\(^2\\)/V·s.\n\nBy combining Equations (5.2) and (5.4), we may write the drift current density due to holes as\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{drift}} = (ep)v_{\\text{dp}} = e\\mu_p pE\n\\]\n\n(5.5)\n\nThe drift current due to holes is in the same direction as the applied electric field. The same discussion of drift applies to electrons. We may write\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{drift}} = pv_{\\text{dn}} = (-en)v_{\\text{dn}}\n\\]\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere \\( J_{\\text{drift}} \\) is the drift current density due to electrons and \\( v_{\\text{dn}} \\) is the average drift velocity of electrons. The net charge density of electrons is negative.\n\nThe average drift velocity of an electron is also proportional to the electric field for small fields. However, since the electron is negatively charged, the net motion of the electron is opposite to the electric field direction. We can then write\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{dn}} = -\\mu_n E\n\\]\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere \\(\\mu_n\\) is the electron mobility and is a positive quantity. Equation (5.6) may now be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{drift}} = (-en)(-\\mu_n E) = e\\mu_n nE\n\\]\n\n(5.8)\n\nThe conventional drift current due to electrons is also in the same direction as the applied electric field even though the electron movement is in the opposite direction.\n\nElectron and hole mobilities are functions of temperature and doping concentrations, as we will see in the next section. Table 5.1 shows some typical mobility values at \\( T = 300 \\, K \\) for low doping concentrations.\n\nSince both electrons and holes contribute to the drift current, the total drift current density is the sum of the individual electron and hole drift current densities, so we may write\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{drift}} = e(\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p)E\n\\]\n\n(5.9)\n\n### 5.1.2 Mobility Effects\n\nIn the previous section, we defined mobility, which relates the average drift velocity of a carrier to the electric field. Electron and hole mobilities are important semiconductor parameters in the characterization of carrier drift, as seen in Equation (5.9).\n\nEquation (5.3) related the acceleration of a hole to a force such as an electric field. We may write this equation as\n\n\\[\nF = m_n \\frac{dv}{dt} = eE\n\\]\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle due to the electric field and does not include the random thermal velocity. If we assume that the conductivity effective mass and electric field are constants, then we may integrate Equation (5.10) and obtain\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{eEt}{m_n^*}\n\\]\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhere we have assumed the initial drift velocity to be zero.\n\nFigure 5.1a shows a schematic model of the random thermal velocity and motion of a hole in a semiconductor with zero electric field. There is a mean time\n\n\n\n**Figure 5.1** Typical random behavior of a hole in a semiconductor (a) without an electric field and (b) with an electric field.\n\nBetween collisions which may be denoted by \\( \\tau_{mp} \\). If a small electric field (E-field) is applied as indicated in Figure 5.1b, there will be a net drift of the hole in the direction of the E-field, and the net drift velocity will be a small perturbation on the random thermal velocity, so the time between collisions will not be altered appreciably. **If we use the mean time between collisions \\( \\tau_{mp} \\) in place of the time \\( t \\) in Equation (5.11), then the mean peak velocity just prior to a collision or scattering event is**\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{peak}} = \\left( \\frac{e \\tau_{mp}}{m_{hp}} \\right) E\n\\]\n\n(5.12a)\n\nThe average drift velocity is one half the peak value so that we can write\n\n\\[\n\\langle v_d \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{e \\tau_{mp}}{m_{hp}} \\right) E\n\\]\n\n(5.12b)\n\nHowever, the collision process is not as simple as this model, but is statistical in nature. In a more accurate model including the effect of a statistical distribution, the factor \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) in Equation (5.12b) does not appear. The hole mobility is then given by\n\n\\[\n\\mu_p = \\frac{v_d}{E} = \\frac{e \\tau_{mp}}{m_{hp}}\n\\]\n\n(5.13)\n\nThe same analysis applies to electrons; thus, we can write the electron mobility as\n\n\\[\n\\mu_n = \\frac{e \\tau_{mn}}{m_{hn}}\n\\]\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere \\( \\tau_{mn} \\) is the mean time between collisions for an electron.\n\nThere are two collision or scattering mechanisms that dominate in a semiconductor and affect the carrier mobility: phonon or lattice scattering, and ionized impurity scattering.\n\nThe atoms in a semiconductor crystal have a certain amount of thermal energy at temperatures above absolute zero that causes the atoms to randomly vibrate about their lattice position within the crystal. The lattice vibrations cause a disruption in the perfect periodic potential function. A perfect periodic potential in a solid allows electrons to move unimpeded, or with no scattering, through the crystal. But the thermal vibrations cause a disruption of the potential function, resulting in an interaction between the electrons or holes and the vibrating lattice atoms. This lattice scattering is also referred to as **phonon scattering**.\n\nSince lattice scattering is related to the thermal motion of atoms, the rate at which the scattering occurs is a function of temperature. If we denote \\( \\mu_L \\) as the mobility that would be observed if only lattice scattering existed, then the scattering theory states that to first order\n\n\\[\n\\mu_L \\propto T^{-3/2}\n\\]\n\n(5.15)\n\nMobility that is due to lattice scattering increases as the temperature decreases. Intuitively, we expect the lattice vibrations to decrease as the temperature decreases, which implies that the probability of a scattering event also decreases, thus increasing mobility.\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the temperature dependence of electron and hole mobilities in silicon. In lightly doped semiconductors, lattice scattering dominates and the carrier mobility decreases with temperature as we have discussed. The temperature dependence of mobility is proportional to \\( T^{-n} \\). The inserts in the figure show that the parameter \\( n \\) is not equal to \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) as the first-order scattering theory predicted. However, mobility does increase as the temperature decreases.\n\nThe second interaction mechanism affecting carrier mobility is called **ionized impurity scattering**. We have seen that impurity atoms are added to the semiconductor to control or alter its characteristics. These impurities are ionized at room temperature so that a coulomb interaction exists between the electrons or holes and the ionized impurities. This coulomb interaction produces scattering or collisions and also alters the velocity characteristics of the charge carrier. If we denote \\( \\mu_i \\) as the mobility that would be observed if only ionized impurity scattering existed, then to first order we have\n\n\\[\n\\mu_i \\propto \\frac{T^{3/2}}{N_i}\n\\]\n\n(5.16)\n\nwhere \\( N_i = N_i^+ + N_i^- \\) is the total ionized impurity concentration in the semiconductor. If temperature increases, the random thermal velocity of a carrier increases, reducing the time the carrier spends in the vicinity of the ionized impurity center. The less time spent in the vicinity of a coulomb force, the smaller the scattering effect and the larger the expected value of \\( \\mu_i \\). If the number of ionized impurity centers increases, then the probability of a carrier encountering an ionized impurity center increases, implying a smaller value of \\( \\mu_i \\).\n\nFigure 5.3 is a plot of electron and hole mobilities in germanium, silicon, and gallium arsenide at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) as a function of impurity concentration. More accurately, these curves are of mobility versus ionized impurity concentration \\( N_i \\). As the impurity concentration increases, the number of impurity scattering centers increases, thus reducing mobility.\n\nIf \\( \\tau_L \\) is the mean time between collisions due to lattice scattering, then \\( dt/\\tau_L \\) is the probability of a lattice scattering event occurring in a differential time \\( dt \\). Likewise, if \\( \\tau_i \\) is the mean time between collisions due to ionized impurity scattering, then \\( dt/\\tau_i \\) is the probability of an ionized impurity scattering event occurring in the differential time \\( dt \\).\n\n**Figure 5-12** (a) Electron and (b) hole mobilities in silicon versus temperature for various doping concentrations.

The parameter \\( \\mu \\) is the net mobility. With two or more independent scattering mechanisms, the inverse mobilities add, which means that the net mobility decreases.\n\n### 5.1.3 Conductivity\n\nThe drift current density, given by Equation (5.9), may be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{dr}} = e(\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p)E = \\sigma E\n\\]\n\n(5.19)\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma\\) is the conductivity of the semiconductor material. The conductivity is given in units of \\((\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm})^{-1}\\) and is a function of the electron and hole concentrations and mobilities. We have just seen that the mobilities are functions of impurity concentrations; conductivity, then is a somewhat complicated function of impurity concentration.\n\nThe reciprocal of conductivity is **resistivity**, which is denoted by \\(\\rho\\) and is given in units of ohm-cm. We can write the formula for resistivity as\n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{e(\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p)}\n\\]\n\n(5.20)\n\nFigure 5.4 is a plot of resistivity as a function of impurity concentration in silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, and gallium phosphide at \\( T = 300 \\, K \\). Obviously, the curves are not linear functions of \\( N_d \\) or \\( N_a \\) because of mobility effects.\n\n*The symbol \\(\\rho\\) is also used for volume charge density. The context in which \\(\\rho\\) is used should make it clear whether it stands for charge density or resistivity.*\n\n\n**Figure 5.4** Resistivity versus impurity concentration at \\( T = 300 \\, \\text{K} \\) in (a) silicon and (b) germanium, gallium arsenide, and gallium phosphide.  \n(From Sze [14].)\n\nGraph (a): Silicon at 300 K\n\n- **Y-axis:** Resistivity \\((\\Omega \\cdot \\text{cm})\\)\n- **X-axis:** Impurity concentration \\((\\text{cm}^{-3})\\)\n- **Curves:**\n  - n-type (phosphorus)\n  - p-type (boron)\n\nGraph (b): Germanium, Gallium Arsenide, and Gallium Phosphide at 300 K\n\n- **Y-axis:** Resistivity \\((\\Omega \\cdot \\text{cm})\\)\n- **X-axis:** Impurity concentration \\((\\text{cm}^{-3})\\)\n- **Curves:**\n  - n-type and p-type for:\n    - p-Ge, n-Ge\n    - p-GaP, n-GaP\n    - n-GaAs, p-GaAs\n\n- **Legend:**\n  - Solid line: n-type\n  - Dashed line: p-type\n\n**Figure 5.5** | Bar of semiconductor material as a resistor.\n\nIf we have a bar of semiconductor material as shown in Figure 5.5 with a voltage applied that produces a current \\( I \\), then we can write\n\n\\[\nJ = \\frac{I}{A}\n\\]\n(5.21a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{V}{L}\n\\]\n(5.21b)\n\nWe can now rewrite Equation (5.19) as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{I}{A} = \\sigma \\left( \\frac{V}{L} \\right)\n\\]\n(5.22a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nV = \\left( \\frac{L}{\\sigma A} \\right) I = \\left( \\frac{\\rho L}{A} \\right) I = IR\n\\]\n(5.22b)\n\nEquation (5.22b) is Ohm’s law for a semiconductor. The resistance is a function of resistivity, or conductivity, as well as the geometry of the semiconductor.\n\nIf we consider, for example, a p-type semiconductor with an acceptor doping \\( N_a(N_d = 0) \\) in which \\( N_a \\gg n_i \\) and if we assume that the electron and hole mobilities are of the same order of magnitude, then the conductivity becomes\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = e(\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p) \\approx e \\mu_p p\n\\]\n(5.23)\n\nIf we also assume complete ionization, then Equation (5.23) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\sigma \\approx e \\mu_p N_a \\approx \\frac{1}{\\rho}\n\\]\n(5.24)\n\nThe conductivity and resistivity of an extrinsic semiconductor are a function primarily of the majority carrier parameters.\n\n**Figure 5.6** | Electron concentration and conductivity versus inverse temperature for silicon.  \n(After Sze [14].)\n\nWe may plot the carrier concentration and conductivity of a semiconductor as a function of temperature for a particular doping concentration. Figure 5.6 shows the electron concentration and conductivity of silicon as a function of inverse temperature for the case when \\( N_d = 10^{15} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\). In the midtemperature range, or extrinsic range, as shown, we have complete ionization—the electron concentration remains essentially constant. However, the mobility is a function of temperature so the conductivity varies with temperature in this range. At higher temperatures, the intrinsic carrier concentration increases and begins to dominate the electron concentration as well as the conductivity. In the lower temperature range, freeze-out begins to occur; the electron concentration and conductivity decrease with decreasing temperature.\n\nFor an intrinsic material, the conductivity can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_i = e(\\mu_n + \\mu_p) n_i \\tag{5.25}\n\\]\n\nThe concentrations of electrons and holes are equal in an intrinsic semiconductor, so the intrinsic conductivity includes both the electron and hole mobility. Since, in general, the electron and hole mobilities are not equal, the intrinsic conductivity is not the minimum value possible at a given temperature.\n\n### 5.1.4 Velocity Saturation\n\nSo far in our discussion of drift velocity, we have assumed that mobility is not a function of electric field, meaning that the drift velocity will increase linearly with applied electric field. The total velocity of a particle is the sum of the random thermal velocity and drift velocity. At \\(T = 300 \\, \\text{K}\\), the average random thermal energy is given by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} m_n v_t^2 = \\frac{3}{2} kT = \\frac{3}{2} (0.0259) = 0.03885 \\, \\text{eV} \\tag{5.26}\n\\]\n\nThis energy translates into a mean thermal velocity of approximately \\(10^7 \\, \\text{cm/s}\\) for an electron in silicon. If we assume an electron mobility of \\(\\mu_n = 1350 \\, \\text{cm}^2/\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s}\\) in low-doped silicon, a drift velocity of \\(10^5 \\, \\text{cm/s}\\), or 1 percent of the thermal velocity, is achieved if the applied electric field is approximately \\(75 \\, \\text{V/cm}\\). This applied electric field does not appreciably alter the energy of the electron.\n\nFigure 5.7 is a plot of average drift velocity as a function of applied electric field for electrons and holes in silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium. At low electric fields, where there is a linear variation of velocity with electric field, the slope of\n\n**Figure 5.7** Carrier drift velocity versus electric field for high-purity silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide. (From Sze [14].)\n\nThe **drift velocity versus electric field curve** is the mobility. The behavior of the drift velocity of carriers at high electric fields deviates substantially from the linear relationship observed at low fields. The drift velocity of electrons in silicon, for example, saturates at approximately \\(10^7 \\, \\text{cm/s}\\) at an electric field of approximately 30 kV/cm. If the drift velocity of a charge carrier saturates, then the drift current density also saturates and becomes independent of the applied electric field.\n\nThe experimental carrier drift velocity versus electric field in silicon can be approximated for electrons by [2]\n\n\\[\nv_n = \\frac{v_s}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E_{eo}}{E}\\right)^{1/2}}\n\\]\n\n(5.27a)\n\nand for holes by\n\n\\[\nv_p = \\frac{v_s}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E_{op}}{E}\\right)^{1/2}}\n\\]\n\n(5.27b)\n\nThe variables are \\(v_s = 10^7 \\, \\text{cm/s}\\) at \\(T = 300 \\, \\text{K}\\), \\(E_{eo} = 7 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{V/cm}\\), and \\(E_{op} = 2 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{V/cm}\\).\n\nWe may note that for small electric fields, the drift velocities reduce to\n\n\\[\nv_n = \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{eo}}\\right) \\cdot v_s\n\\]\n\n(5.28a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nv_p = \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{op}}\\right) \\cdot v_s\n\\]\n\n(5.28b)\n\nAt low electric fields, the drift velocities are linear functions of the electric field as we have discussed. However, for large electric fields, the drift velocities approach the saturation value.\n\nThe drift velocity versus electric field characteristic of gallium arsenide is more complicated than for silicon or germanium. At low fields, the slope of the drift velocity versus E-field is constant and is the low-field electron mobility, which is approximately 8500 cm\\(^2\\)/V·s for gallium arsenide. The low-field electron mobility in gallium arsenide is much larger than in silicon. As the field increases, the electron drift velocity in gallium arsenide reaches a peak and then decreases. A differential mobility is the slope of the \\(v_d\\) versus E curve at a particular point on the curve and the negative slope of the drift velocity versus electric field represents a negative differential mobility. The negative differential mobility produces a negative differential resistance; this characteristic is used in the design of oscillators.\n\nThe negative differential mobility can be understood by considering the E versus k diagram for gallium arsenide, which is shown again in Figure 5.8. The density of states effective mass of the electron in the lower valley is \\(m_n^* = 0.067 m_0\\). The small effective mass leads to a large mobility. As the E-field increases, the energy of the electron increases and the electron can be scattered into the upper valley, where the density of states effective mass is 0.55\\(m_0\\). The larger effective mass in the upper valley yields a smaller mobility. This intervalley transfer mechanism results in a decreasing average drift velocity of electrons with electric field, or the negative differential mobility characteristic.\n\n**Figure 5.8** Energy-band structure for gallium arsenide showing the upper valley and lower valley in the conduction band.  \n*(From Sze [15].)*",

We may consider a classic physics example in which a container, as shown in Figure 5.9, is divided into two parts by a membrane. The left side contains gas molecules at a particular temperature and the right side is initially empty. The gas molecules are in continual random thermal motion so that, when the membrane is broken, the gas molecules flow into the right side of the container. **Diffusion is the process whereby particles flow from a region of high concentration toward a region of low concentration.** If the gas molecules were electrically charged, the net flow of charge would result in a diffusion current.\n\n### 5.2.1 Diffusion Current Density\n\nTo begin to understand the diffusion process in a semiconductor, we will consider a simplified analysis. Assume that an electron concentration varies in one dimension as shown in Figure 5.10.

One half of the electrons at \\(x = -l\\) will be traveling to the right at any instant of time and one half of the electrons at \\(x = +l\\) will be traveling to the left at any given time. The net rate of electron flow, \\(F_n\\), in the \\(+x\\) direction at \\(x = 0\\) is given by\n\n\\[\nF_n = \\frac{1}{2} n(-l)v_{th,n} - \\frac{1}{2} n(+l)v_{th,n} = \\frac{1}{2} v_{th}[n(-l) - n(+l)]\n\\]\n\n(5.29)\n\nIf we expand the electron concentration in a Taylor series about \\(x = 0\\) keeping only the first two terms, then we can write Equation (5.29) as\n\n\\[\nF_n = \\frac{1}{2} v_{th} \\left[ n(0) - \\frac{dn}{dx} - n(0) + \\frac{dn}{dx} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(5.30)\n\nwhich becomes\n\n\\[\nF_n = -v_{th} l \\frac{dn}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(5.31)\n\nEach electron has a charge \\((-e)\\), so the current is\n\n\\[\nJ = -eF_n = e v_{th} l \\frac{dn}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(5.32)\n\nThe current described by Equation (5.32) is the electron diffusion current and is proportional to the spatial derivative, or density gradient, of the electron concentration.\n\nThe diffusion of electrons from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration produces a flux of electrons flowing in the negative \\(x\\) direction for this example.

The electron diffusion coefficient gives an indication of how well an electron moves in a semiconductor as a result of a density gradient. The electron mobility and diffusion coefficient are not independent parameters. Similarly, the hole mobility and diffusion coefficient are not independent parameters. The relationship between mobility and the diffusion coefficient is developed in the next section.\n\nThe expression for the total current in a semiconductor contains four terms.

The doping concentration decreases as \\( x \\) increases in this case.

When equilibrium is reached, the mobile carrier concentration is not exactly equal to the fixed impurity concentration and the induced electric field prevents any further separation of charge.

The work functions of various metals are given in Table 9.1 and the electron affinities of several semiconductors are given in Table 9.2. In Figure 9.1a, we have assumed that \\( \\phi_m > \\phi_n \\). The ideal thermal-equilibrium metal–semiconductor energy-band diagram, for this situation, is shown in Figure 9.1b. Before contact, the Fermi level in the semiconductor was above that in the metal. In order for the Fermi level to become a constant through the system in thermal equilibrium, electrons from the semiconductor flow into the lower energy states in the metal. Positively charged donor atoms remain in the semiconductor, creating a space charge region.\n\nThe parameter \\( \\phi_{B0} \\) is the ideal barrier height of the semiconductor contact, the potential barrier seen by electrons in the metal trying to move into the semiconductor. This barrier is known as the Schottky barrier and is given, ideally, by\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{B0} = (\\phi_m - \\chi)\n\\]\n\n(9.1)\n\nOn the semiconductor side, \\( V_{bi} \\) is the built-in potential barrier. This barrier, similar to the case of the pn junction, is the barrier seen by electrons in the conduction band trying to move into the metal. The built-in potential barrier is given by\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = \\phi_{B0} - \\phi_n\n\\]\n\n(9.2)\n\nwhich makes \\( V_{bi} \\) a slight function of the semiconductor doping, as is the case in a pn junction.\n\nIf we apply a positive voltage to the semiconductor with respect to the metal, the semiconductor-to-metal barrier height increases, while \\( \\phi_{B0} \\) remains constant in this idealized case. This bias condition is the reverse bias. If a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to the semiconductor, the semiconductor-to-metal barrier \\( V_{bi} \\) is reduced while \\( \\phi_{B0} \\) again remains essentially constant. In this situation, electrons can more easily flow from the semiconductor into the metal since the barrier has been reduced. This bias condition is the forward bias. The energy-band diagrams for the reverse and forward bias are shown in Figures 9.2a,b where \\( V_R \\) is the magnitude of the reverse-biased voltage and \\( V_a \\) is the magnitude of the forward-bias voltage.\n\n\n**Figure 9.2** Ideal energy-band diagram of a metal–semiconductor junction (a) under reverse bias and (b) under forward bias.\n\nThe energy-band diagrams versus voltage for the metal–semiconductor junction shown in Figure 9.2 are very similar to those of the pn junction given in the previous chapter. Because of this similarity, we expect the current–voltage characteristics of the Schottky barrier junction to be similar to the exponential behavior of the pn junction diode. The current mechanism here, however, is due to the flow of majority carrier electrons. In forward bias, the barrier seen by the electrons in the semiconductor is reduced, so majority carrier electrons flow more easily from the semiconductor into the metal. The forward-bias current is in the direction from metal to semiconductor: It is an exponential function of the forward-bias voltage \\( V_a \\).\n\n### 9.1.2 Ideal Junction Properties\n\nWe can determine the electrostatic properties of the junction in the same way as we do for the pn junction. The electric field in the space charge region is determined from Poisson’s equation. We have that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(9.3)\n\nwhere \\( \\rho(x) \\) is the space charge volume density and \\( \\varepsilon_s \\) is the permittivity of the semiconductor. If we assume that the semiconductor doping is uniform, then by integrating Equation (9.3), we obtain\n\n\\[\nE = \\int \\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s} dx = \\frac{eN_d x}{\\varepsilon_s} + C_1\n\\]\n\n(9.4)\n\nwhere \\( C_1 \\) is a constant of integration. The electric field is zero at the space charge edge in the semiconductor, so the constant of integration can be found as\n\n\\[\nC_1 = -\\frac{eN_d x_n}{\\varepsilon_s}\n\\]\n\n(9.5)\n\nThe electric field can then be written as\n\n\\[\nE = -\\frac{eN_d}{\\varepsilon_s} (x_n - x)\n\\]\n\n(9.6)\n\nwhich is a linear function of distance, for the uniformly doped semiconductor, and reaches a peak value at the metal–semiconductor interface. Since the E-field is zero inside the metal, a negative surface charge must exist in the metal at the metal–semiconductor junction.\n\nThe space charge region width, \\( W \\), may be calculated as we do for the pn junction. The result is identical to that of a one-sided p\\(^+\\)n junction. For the uniformly doped semiconductor, we have\n\n\\[\nW = x_n = \\left[ \\frac{2\\varepsilon_s(V_{bi} + V_R)}{eN_d} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(9.7)\n\nwhere \\( V_R \\) is the magnitude of the applied reverse-biased voltage. We are again assuming an abrupt junction approximation.\n\nA junction capacitance can also be determined in the same way as we do for the pn junction. We have that\n\n\\[\nC' = eN_d \\frac{dx_n}{dV_R} = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\, \\varepsilon e \\, N_d}{(V_{bi} + V_R)} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(9.8)\n\nwhere \\( C' \\) is the capacitance per unit area. If we square the reciprocal of Equation (9.8), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{C'} \\right)^2 = \\frac{2(V_{bi} + V_R)}{\\varepsilon e N_d}\n\\]\n\n(9.9)\n\nWe can use Equation (9.9) to obtain, to a first approximation, the built-in potential barrier \\( V_{bi} \\), and the slope of the curve from Equation (9.9) to yield the semiconductor doping \\( N_d \\). We can calculate the potential \\( \\phi_n \\), and then determine the Schottky barrier \\( \\phi_{bn} \\) from Equation (9.2).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{(c. } W) & : 0.01 \\times 2.9 = N \\times 1.9 \\times 0 = N \\times 1.9 \\times 1.9 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ cm}^{-3}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe can see that the built-in potential barrier of the gallium arsenide Schottky diode is larger than that of the silicon diode. This experimental result is normally observed for all types of metal contacts.\n\n### 9.1.3 Nonideal Effects on the Barrier Height\n\n**Schottky Barrier Lowering**\n\nSeveral effects alter the actual Schottky barrier height from the theoretical value given by Equation (9.1). The first such effect that we consider is the Schottky effect, or image-force-induced lowering of the potential barrier.\n\nAn electron in a dielectric material at a distance \\( x \\) from the metal will create an electric field. The electric field can be determined by adding an image charge, \\( +e \\), inside the metal located at the same distance, \\( |x| \\), from the interface. This image effect is shown in Figure 9.4a. Note that the E–field lines are perpendicular to the metal surface as we expect. The force on the electron, due to the coulomb attraction with the image force, is\n\n\\[\nF = \\frac{-e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{e}(2x)^2} = -eE\n\\]\n\n(9.10)\n\n\n**Figure 9.4** (a) Image charge and electric field lines at a metal–dielectric interface.  \n(b) Distortion of the potential barrier due to image forces with zero electric field and (c) with a constant electric field.\n\nThe potential can then be found as\n\n\\[\n-\\phi(x) = + \\int_{x}^{\\infty} Edx' = + \\int_{x}^{\\infty} \\frac{e}{4\\pi \\epsilon_s (4x')^2} dx' = \\frac{-e}{16\\pi \\epsilon_s x}\n\\]\n\n(9.11)\n\nwhere \\( x' \\) is the integration variable and where we have assumed that the potential is zero at \\( x = \\infty \\).\n\nThe potential energy of the electron is \\(-e\\phi(x)\\). Figure 9.4b is a plot of the potential energy assuming that no other electric fields exist. With an electric field present in the dielectric, the potential is modified and can be written as\n\n\\[\n-e\\phi(x) = \\frac{-e}{16\\pi \\epsilon_s x} - eEx\n\\]\n\n(9.12)\n\nThe potential energy of the electron, including the effect of a constant electric field, is plotted in Figure 9.4c. The peak potential barrier is now lowered. This lowering of the potential barrier is the Schottky effect, or image force–induced lowering.\n\nWe can find the Schottky barrier lowering, \\(\\Delta \\phi\\), and the position of the maximum barrier, \\( x_m \\), from the condition that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d[e\\phi(x)]}{dx} = 0\n\\]\n\n(9.13)\n\nWe find that\n\n\\[\nx_m = \\sqrt{\\frac{e}{16\\pi \\epsilon_s E}}\n\\]\n\n(9.14)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi = \\sqrt{\\frac{eE}{4\\pi \\epsilon_s}}\n\\]\n\n(9.15)\n\n**Interface States**\nFigure 9.5 shows the measured barrier heights in gallium arsenide and silicon Schottky diodes as a function of metal work functions. There is a monotonic relation between the measured barrier height and the metal work function, but the curves do not fit the simple relation given in Equation (9.1). The barrier height of the metal–semiconductor junction is determined by both the metal work function and the semiconductor surface or interface states.\n\nA more detailed energy-band diagram of a metal to n-type semiconductor contact in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 9.6. We assume that a narrow interfacial layer of insulator exists between the metal and semiconductor. The interfacial layer can support a potential difference, but will be transparent to the flow of electrons between the metal and semiconductor. The semiconductor also shows a distribution of surface states at the metal–semiconductor interface. We assume that all states below\n\n\n**Figure 9.5** Experimental barrier heights as a function of metal work functions for GaAs and Si.  \n\n| Metal work function, \\(\\phi_m\\) (eV) | Barrier height, \\(\\phi_B\\) (eV) |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 3.0                                  | 0.2                             |\n| 4.0                                  | 0.4                             |\n| 5.0                                  | 0.6                             |\n| 6.0                                  | 0.8                             |\n| GaAs                                 | 1.0                             |\n| Si                                   | 0.6                             |\n| Mg                                   |                                 |\n| Al                                   |                                 |\n| Ag W                                 |                                 |\n| Au                                   |                                 |\n| Pd                                   |                                 |\n| Pt                                   |                                 |\n\nThis figure shows the experimental Schottky barrier heights ($e\\phi_{Bn}$) as a function of metal work functions ($e\\phi_m$) for silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs).  \nFor Si, the barrier height increases significantly with increasing metal work function, indicating a strong dependence.  \nFor GaAs, the barrier height remains nearly constant regardless of the metal used, showing weak dependence on metal work function.  \nThis suggests that Si follows the Schottky–Mott model more closely, while GaAs exhibits Fermi-level pinning due to surface states.  \nThe data are derived from measurements involving metals like Mg, Al, Ag, W, Au, Pd, and Pt.\n\n\n**Figure 9.6** | Energy-band diagram of a metal–semiconductor junction with an interfacial layer and interface states.\n\nThe surface potential \\( \\phi_0 \\) are donor states, which will be neutral if the state contains an electron and positively charged if the state does not contain an electron. We also assume that all states above \\( \\phi_0 \\) are acceptor states, which will be neutral if the state does not contain an electron and negatively charged if the state contains an electron.\n\nThe diagram in Figure 9.6 shows some acceptor states above \\( \\phi_0 \\) and below \\( E_F \\). These states tend to contain electrons and are negatively charged. We may assume that the surface state density is constant and equal to \\( D_s \\) states/cm\\(^2\\)-eV. The relation between the surface potential, surface state density, and other semiconductor parameters is found to be\n\n\\[\n(E_s - e\\phi_0 - e\\phi_{bn}) = \\frac{1}{eD_{it}} \\sqrt{2\\epsilon_s N_d(\\phi_{bn} - \\phi_s)} - \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{eD_s \\delta} [\\phi_m - (\\chi + \\phi_{bn})]\n\\]\n\n(9.16)\n\nWe consider two limiting cases.\n\n**Case 1**  \nLet \\( D_s \\rightarrow \\infty \\). In this case, the right side of Equation (9.16) goes to zero. We then have\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{bn} = \\frac{1}{e} (E_s - e\\phi_0)\n\\]\n\n(9.17)\n\nThe barrier height is now fixed by the bandgap energy and the potential \\( \\phi_0 \\). The barrier height is totally independent of the metal work function and the semiconductor electron affinity. The Fermi level becomes “pinned” at the surface, at the surface potential \\( \\phi_0 \\).\n\n**Case 2**  \nLet \\( D_s \\delta \\rightarrow 0 \\). Equation (9.16) reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\phi_{bn} = (\\phi_m - \\chi)\n\\]\n\nwhich is the original ideal expression.\n\nThe Schottky barrier height is a function of the electric field in the semiconductor through the barrier lowering effect. The barrier height is also a function of the surface states in the semiconductor. The barrier height, then, is modified from the ideal theoretical value. Since the surface state density is not predictable with any degree of certainty, the barrier height must be an experimentally determined parameter.\n\n### 9.1.4 Current–Voltage Relationship\n\nThe current transport in a metal–semiconductor junction is due mainly to majority carriers as opposed to minority carriers in a pn junction. The basic process in the rectifying contact with an n-type semiconductor is by transport of electrons over the potential barrier, which can be described by the thermionic emission theory.\n\nThe thermionic emission characteristics are derived by assuming that the barrier height is much larger than \\(kT\\), so that the Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation applies and that thermal equilibrium is not affected by this process. Figure 9.7 shows the one-dimensional barrier with an applied forward-bias voltage \\(V_a\\) and two electron current density components. The current \\(J_{s,em}\\) is the electron current density due to the flow of electrons from the semiconductor into the metal, and the current \\(J_{s,m}\\) is the electron current density due to the flow of electrons from the metal into the semiconductor. The subscripts of the currents indicate the direction of electron flow. The conventional current direction is opposite to electron flow.\n\n\n**Figure 9.7** Energy-band diagram of a forward-biased metal–semiconductor junction including the image lowering effect.\n\nThe current density \\( J_{x,n} \\) is a function of the concentration of electrons which have \\( x \\)-directed velocities sufficient to overcome the barrier. We may write\n\n\\[\nJ_{x,n} = e \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} v_x \\, dn\n\\]\n\n(9.18)\n\nwhere \\( E_c \\) is the minimum energy required for thermionic emission into the metal, \\( v \\) is the carrier velocity in the direction of transport, and \\( e \\) is the magnitude of the electronic charge. The incremental electron concentration is given by\n\n\\[\ndn = g_c(E) f_f(E) \\, dE\n\\]\n\n(9.19)\n\nwhere \\( g_c(E) \\) is the density of states in the conduction band and \\( f_f(E) \\) is the Fermi-Dirac probability function. Assuming that the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation applies, we may write\n\n\\[\ndn = \\frac{4\\pi(2m_n^*)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c} \\exp \\left[ -\\frac{(E - E_f)}{kT} \\right] dE\n\\]\n\n(9.20)\n\nIf all of the electron energy above \\( E_c \\) is assumed to be kinetic energy, then we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} m_n^* v^2 = E - E_c\n\\]\n\n(9.21)\n\nThe net current density in the metal-to-semiconductor junction can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ = J_{x,n} - J_{x,-n}\n\\]\n\n(9.22)\n\nwhich is defined to be positive in the direction from the metal to the semiconductor. We find that\n\n\\[\nJ = \\left[ A^* T^2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{e\\phi_{bn}}{kT} \\right) \\right] \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(9.23)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nA^* = \\frac{4\\pi m_n^* k^2}{h^3}\n\\]\n\n(9.24)\n\nThe parameter \\( A^* \\) is called the effective Richardson constant for thermionic emission. Equation (9.23) can be written in the usual diode form as\n\n\\[\nJ = J_{sT} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(9.25)\n\nwhere \\( J_{sT} \\) is the reverse-saturation current density and is given by\n\n\\[\nJ_{sT} = A^* T^2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{e\\phi_{bn}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.26)\n\nWe may recall that the Schottky barrier height \\( \\phi_{bn} \\) changes because of the image-force lowering. We have that \\( \\phi_{bn} = \\phi_{b0} - \\Delta \\phi \\). Then we can write Equation (9.26) as\n\n**Figure 9.8** Experimental and theoretical reverse-biased currents in a PtSi-Si diode. (From Sze and Ng [15].)\n\n\\[\nJ_{R} = A^* T^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{-e\\phi_{B0}}{kT}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\Delta\\phi}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.27)\n\nThe change in barrier height, \\(\\Delta \\phi\\), will increase with an increase in the electric field, or with an increase in the applied reverse-biased voltage. Figure 9.8 shows a typical reverse-biased current–voltage characteristic of a Schottky barrier diode. The reverse-biased current increases with reverse-biased voltage because of the barrier lowering effect. This figure also shows the Schottky barrier diode going into breakdown.\n\nWe may note that the reverse-saturation current densities of the tungsten–silicon and tungsten–gallium arsenide diodes in Figure 9.9 differ by approximately two orders of magnitude. This two order of magnitude difference will be reflected in the effective Richardson constant, assuming the barrier heights in the two diodes are essentially the same. The definition of the effective Richardson constant, given by Equation (9.24), contains the electron effective mass, which differs substantially between silicon and gallium arsenide. The fact that the effective mass is in the expression for the Richardson constant is a direct result of using the effective density of states function in the thermionic emission theory. The net result is that \\( A^* \\) and \\( J_{sr} \\) will vary widely between silicon and gallium arsenide.\n\n### 9.1.5 Comparison of the Schottky Barrier Diode and the pn Junction Diode\n\nAlthough the ideal current–voltage relationship of the Schottky barrier diode given by Equation (9.25) is of the same form as that of the pn junction diode, there are two important differences between a Schottky diode and a pn junction diode: The first is in the magnitudes of the reverse-saturation current densities and the second is in the switching characteristics.\n\nThe reverse-saturation current density of the Schottky barrier diode was given by Equation (9.26) and is\n\n\\[\nJ_{sT} = A^* T^2 \\exp \\left( \\frac{-e \\phi_{Bn}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe ideal reverse-saturation current density of the pn junction diode can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_s = \\frac{e D_n n_{po}}{L_n} + \\frac{e D_p p_{no}}{L_p}\n\\]\n\n(9.28)\n\nThe form of the two equations is vastly different, and the current mechanism in the two devices is different. The current in a pn junction is determined by the diffusion of minority carriers while the current in a Schottky barrier diode is determined by thermionic emission of majority carriers over a potential barrier.\n\n**Figure 9.10** Comparison of forward-bias I-V characteristics between a Schottky diode and a pn junction diode.\n\nRecall that the reverse-biased current in a silicon pn junction diode is dominated by the generation current. A typical generation current density is approximately \\(10^{-7} \\, \\text{A/cm}^2\\), which is still two to three orders of magnitude less than the reverse-saturation current density of the Schottky barrier diode. A generation current also exists in the reverse-biased Schottky barrier diode; however, the generation current is negligible compared with the \\(J_{0}\\) value.\n\nSince \\(J_{0T} \\gg J_{0}\\), the forward-bias characteristics of the two types of diodes will also be different. Figure 9.10 shows typical I-V characteristics of a Schottky barrier diode and a pn junction diode. The effective turn-on voltage of the Schottky diode is less than that of the pn junction diode.\n\nThe actual difference between the turn-on voltages will be a function of the barrier height of the metal–semiconductor contact and the doping concentrations in the pn junction, but the relatively large difference will always be realized. We will consider one application that utilizes the difference in turn-on voltage in Chapter 12, in what is referred to as a **Schottky clamped transistor**.\n\nThe second major difference between a Schottky barrier diode and a pn junction diode is in the frequency response, or switching characteristics. In our discussion, we have considered the current in a Schottky diode as being due to the injection of majority carriers over a potential barrier. The energy-band diagram of Figure 9.1, for example, shows that there can be electrons in the metal directly adjacent to empty states in the semiconductor. If an electron from the valence band of the semiconductor were to flow into the metal, this effect would be equivalent to holes being injected into the semiconductor. This injection of holes would create excess minority carrier holes in the n region. However, calculations as well as measurements have shown that the ratio of the minority carrier hole current to the total current is extremely low in most cases.\n\nThe Schottky barrier diode, then, is a majority carrier device. This fact means that there is no diffusion capacitance associated with a forward-biased Schottky diode. The elimination of the diffusion capacitance makes the Schottky diode a higher-frequency device than the pn junction diode. Also, when switching a Schottky diode from forward to reverse bias, there is no minority carrier stored charge to remove, as is the case in the pn junction diode. Since there is no minority carrier storage time, the Schottky diodes can be used in fast-switching applications. A typical switching time for a Schottky diode is in the picosecond range, while for a pn junction it is normally in the nanosecond range.",

    "text": "## 9.2 METAL–SEMICONDUCTOR OHMIC CONTACTS\n\nContacts must be made between any semiconductor device, or integrated circuit, and the outside world. These contacts are made via **ohmic contacts**. Ohmic contacts are metal-to-semiconductor contacts, but in this case they are not rectifying contacts. An ohmic contact is a low-resistance junction providing conduction in both directions between the metal and the semiconductor. Ideally, the current through the ohmic contact is a linear function of applied voltage, and the applied voltage should be very small. Two general types of ohmic contacts are possible: The first type is the ideal nonrectifying barrier, and the second is the tunneling barrier. We define in this section a specific contact resistance that is used to characterize ohmic contacts.\n\n### 9.2.1 Ideal Nonrectifying Barrier\n\nWe have considered an ideal metal-n-type semiconductor contact in Figure 9.1 for the case when \\(\\phi_m > \\phi_s\\). Figure 9.11 shows the same ideal contact for the opposite case of \\(\\phi_m < \\phi_s\\). In Figure 9.11a we see the energy levels before contact, and in Figure 9.11b, the barrier after contact for thermal equilibrium. To achieve thermal equilibrium in this junction, electrons flow from the metal into the lower energy states in the semiconductor, which makes the surface of the semiconductor more n type. The excess electron charge in the n-type semiconductor exists essentially as a surface charge density. If a positive voltage is applied to the metal, there is no barrier to electrons flowing from the semiconductor into the metal. If a positive voltage is applied to the semiconductor, the effective barrier height for electrons flowing from the metal into the semiconductor will be approximately \\(\\phi_{bn} = \\phi_{bn}\\), which is fairly small for a moderately to heavily doped semiconductor. For this bias condition, electrons can easily flow from the metal into the semiconductor.\n\nFigure 9.12a shows the energy-band diagram when a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to the semiconductor. Electrons can easily flow “downhill” \n\n\n**Figure 9.11** Ideal energy-band diagram (a) before contact and (b) after contact for a metal-n-type semiconductor junction for \\(\\phi_m < \\phi_s\\).\n\n**Figure 9.12** Ideal energy-band diagram of a metal-n-type semiconductor ohmic contact (a) with a positive voltage applied to the metal and (b) with a positive voltage applied to the semiconductor.\n\n**Figure 9.13** Ideal energy-band diagram (a) before contact and (b) after contact for a metal–p-type semiconductor junction for \\(\\phi_m < \\phi_b\\).\n\n\nFrom the semiconductor into the metal. Figure 9.12b shows the case when a positive voltage is applied to the semiconductor with respect to the metal. Electrons can easily flow over the barrier from the metal into the semiconductor. This junction, then, is an ohmic contact.\n\nFigure 9.13 shows an ideal nonrectifying contact between a metal and a p-type semiconductor. Figure 9.13a shows the energy levels before contact for the case when \\(\\phi_m > \\phi_b\\). When contact is made, electrons from the semiconductor flow into the metal to achieve thermal equilibrium, leaving behind more empty states, or holes. The excess concentration of holes at the surface makes the surface of the semiconductor more p-type. Electrons from the metal can readily move into the empty states in the semiconductor. This charge movement corresponds to holes flowing from the semiconductor into the metal. We can also visualize holes in the metal flowing into the semiconductor. This junction is also an ohmic contact.\n\nThe ideal energy bands shown in Figures 9.11 and 9.13 do not take into account the effect of surface states. If we assume that acceptor surface states exist in\n\n**Figure 9.14** | Energy-band diagram of a heavily doped n-semiconductor-to-metal junction.\n\nThe upper half of the semiconductor bandgap, then, since all the acceptor states are below \\( E_F \\) for the case shown in Figure 9.11b, these surface states will be negatively charged and will alter the energy-band diagram. Similarly, if we assume that donor surface states exist in the lower half of the bandgap, then all of the donor states will be positively charged for the case shown in Figure 9.13b; the positively charged surface states will also alter this energy-band diagram. Therefore, if \\( \\phi_m < \\phi_b \\) for the metal-n-type semiconductor contact, and if \\( \\phi_m > \\phi_b \\) for the metal-p-type semiconductor contact, we may not necessarily form a good ohmic contact.\n\n### 9.2.2 Tunneling Barrier\n\nThe space charge width in a rectifying metal–semiconductor contact is inversely proportional to the square root of the semiconductor doping. The width of the depletion region decreases as the doping concentration in the semiconductor increases; thus, as the doping concentration increases, the probability of tunneling through the barrier increases. Figure 9.14 shows a junction in which the metal is in contact with a heavily doped n-type epitaxial layer.\n\nThe tunneling current has the form\n\n\\[\nJ_t \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e \\phi_b}{E_{00}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.29)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nE_{00} = \\frac{e \\hbar}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{N_d}{\\epsilon_s m_t^*}}\n\\]\n\n(9.30)\n\nThe tunneling current increases exponentially with doping concentration.\n\n### 9.2.3 Specific Contact Resistance\n\nA figure of merit of ohmic contacts is the specific contact resistance, \\( R_c \\). This parameter is defined as the reciprocal of the derivative of current density with respect to voltage evaluated at zero bias. We may write\n\n\\[\nR_c = \\left( \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V} \\right)^{-1} \\bigg|_{V=0} \\, \\Omega\\text{-cm}^2\n\\]\n\n(9.31)\n\nWe want \\( R_c \\) to be as small as possible for an ohmic contact.\n\nFor a rectifying contact with a low to moderate semiconductor doping concentration, the current–voltage relation is given by Equation (9.23) as\n\n\\[\nJ_n = A^* T^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e \\phi_b}{kT}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV}{kT}\\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\nThe thermionic emission current is dominant in this junction. The specific contact resistance for this case is then\n\n\\[\nR_c = \\left(\\frac{kT}{e}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{+e \\phi_b}{kT}\\right) \\frac{1}{A^* T^2}\n\\]\n\n(9.32)\n\nThe specific contact resistance decreases rapidly as the barrier height decreases.\n\nFor a metal–semiconductor junction with a high impurity doping concentration, the tunneling process will dominate. From Equations (9.29) and (9.30), the specific contact resistance is found to be\n\n\\[\nR_c \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{+2 \\sqrt{2 \\epsilon_s m_t^*}}{\\hbar} \\cdot \\frac{\\phi_b}{\\sqrt{N_d}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.33)\n\n**Figure 9.15** | Theoretical and experimental specific contact resistance as a function of doping.  \n*(From Sze and Ng [15].)*\n\nwhich shows that the specific contact resistance is a very strong function of semiconductor doping.\n\nFigure 9.15 shows a plot of the theoretical values of \\( R_c \\) as a function of semiconductor doping. For doping concentrations greater than approximately \\( 10^{19} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\), the tunneling process dominates and \\( R_c \\) shows the exponential dependence on \\( N_D \\). For lower doping concentrations, the \\( R_c \\) values are dependent on the barrier heights and become almost independent of the doping. Also shown in the figure are experimental data for platinum silicide–silicon and aluminum–silicon junctions.\n\nEquation (9.33) is the specific contact resistance of the tunneling junction, which corresponds to the metal–\\( n^+ \\) contact shown in Figure 9.14. However, the \\( n^+n \\) junction also has a specific contact resistance, since there is a barrier associated with this junction. For a fairly low doped \\( n \\) region, this contact resistance may actually dominate the total resistance of the junction.\n\nThe theory of forming ohmic contacts is straightforward. To form a good ohmic contact, we need to create a low barrier and use a highly doped semiconductor at the surface. However, the actual technology of fabricating good, reliable ohmic contacts is not as easy in practice as in theory. It is also more difficult to fabricate good ohmic contacts on wide-bandgap materials. In general, low barriers are not possible on these materials, so a heavily doped semiconductor at the surface must be used to form a tunneling contact. The formation of a tunneling junction requires diffusion, ion implantation, or perhaps epitaxial growth. The surface doping concentration in",

    "text": "## 9.3 HETEROJUNCTIONS\n\nIn the discussion of pn junctions in the previous chapters, we assumed that the semiconductor material is homogeneous throughout the structure. This type of junction is called a **homojunction**. When two different semiconductor materials are used to form a junction, the junction is called a **semiconductor heterojunction**.\n\nAs with many topics in this text, our goal is to provide the basic concepts concerning the heterojunction. The complete analysis of heterojunction structures involves quantum mechanics and detailed calculations that are beyond the scope of this text. The discussion of heterojunctions will, then, be limited to the introduction of some basic concepts.\n\n### 9.3.1 Heterojunction Materials\n\nSince the two materials used to form a heterojunction will have different energy bandgaps, the energy band will have a discontinuity at the junction interface. We may have an abrupt junction in which the semiconductor changes abruptly from a narrow-bandgap material to a wide-bandgap material. On the other hand, if we have a GaAs–Al\\(_x\\)Ga\\(_{1-x}\\)As system, for example, the value of \\(x\\) may continuously vary over a distance of several nanometers to form a graded heterojunction. Changing the value of \\(x\\) in the Al\\(_x\\)Ga\\(_{1-x}\\)As system allows us to engineer, or design, the bandgap energy.\n\nIn order to have a useful heterojunction, the lattice constants of the two materials must be well matched. The lattice match is important because any lattice mismatch can introduce dislocations resulting in interface states. For example, germanium and gallium arsenide have lattice constants matched to within approximately 0.13 percent. Germanium–gallium arsenide heterojunctions have been studied quite extensively. More recently, gallium arsenide–aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs–AlGaAs) junctions have been investigated quite thoroughly, since the lattice constants of GaAs and the AlGaAs system vary by no more than 0.14 percent.\n\n### 9.3.2 Energy-Band Diagrams\n\nIn the formation of a heterojunction with a narrow-bandgap material and a wide-bandgap material, the alignment of the bandgap energies is important in determining the characteristics of the junction. Figure 9.16 shows three possible situations. In Figure 9.16a, we see the case when the forbidden bandgap of the wide-gap material completely overlaps the bandgap of the narrow-gap material. This case, called **straddling**, applies to most heterojunctions. We consider only this case here. The other possibilities are called **staggered** and **broken gap** and are shown in Figure 9.16b,c.\n\n**Figure 9.16** Relation between narrow-bandgap and wide-bandgap energies: (a) straddling, (b) staggered, and (c) broken gap.\n\nThere are four basic types of heterojunction. Those in which the dopant type changes at the junction are called anisotype. We can form nP or Np junctions, where the capital letter indicates the larger-bandgap material. Heterojunctions with the same dopant type on either side of the junction are called isotype. We can form nN and pP isotype heterojunctions.\n\nFigure 9.17 shows the energy-band diagrams of isolated n-type and p-type materials, with the vacuum level used as a reference. The electron affinity of the wide-bandgap material is less than that of the narrow-bandgap material. The difference between the two conduction band energies is denoted by \\(\\Delta E_c\\), and the difference between the two valence band energies is denoted by \\(\\Delta E_v\\). From Figure 9.17, we can see that\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_c = e(\\chi_n - \\chi_p)\n\\]\n\n(9.34a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_c + \\Delta E_v = E_{g,p} - E_{g,n} = \\Delta E_g\n\\]\n\n(9.34b)\n\nIn the ideal abrupt heterojunction using nondegenerately doped semiconductors, the vacuum level is parallel to both conduction bands and valence bands. If the vacuum level is continuous, then the same \\(\\Delta E_c\\) and \\(\\Delta E_v\\) discontinuities will exist at the junction.\n\n**Figure 9.17** Energy-band diagrams of a narrow-bandgap and a wide-bandgap material before contact.\n\n\n**Figure 9.18** | Ideal energy-band diagram of an nP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\n\nHeterojunction interface. This ideal situation is known as the **electron affinity rule**. There is still some uncertainty about the applicability of this rule, but it provides a good starting point for the discussion of heterojunctions.\n\nFigure 9.18 shows a general ideal nP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. In order for the Fermi levels in the two materials to become aligned, electrons from the narrow-gap n region and holes from the wide-gap P region must flow across the junction. As in the case of a homojunction, this flow of charge creates a space charge region in the vicinity of the metallurgical junction. The space charge width into the n-type region is denoted by \\( x_n \\), and the space charge width into the P-type region is denoted by \\( x_p \\). The discontinuities in the conduction and valence bands and the change in the vacuum level are shown in the figure.\n\n### 9.3.3 Two-Dimensional Electron Gas\n\nBefore we consider the electrostatics of the heterojunction, we will discuss a unique characteristic of an isotype junction. Figure 9.19 shows the energy-band diagram of an nN GaAs–AlGaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. The AlGaAs can be moderately to heavily doped n type, while the GaAs can be more lightly doped or even intrinsic. As mentioned previously, to achieve thermal equilibrium, electrons from the wide-bandgap AlGaAs flow into the GaAs, forming an accumulation layer of electrons in the potential well adjacent to the interface. One basic quantum-mechanical result that we have found previously is that the energy of an electron contained in a potential well is quantized. The phrase **two-dimensional electron gas**\n\n**Figure 9.19** Ideal energy-band diagram of an nN heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe diagram refers to the condition in which the electrons have quantized energy levels in one spatial direction (perpendicular to the interface), but are free to move in the other two spatial directions.\n\nThe potential function near the interface can be approximated by a triangular potential well. Figure 9.20a shows the conduction band edges near the abrupt junction interface and Figure 9.20b shows the approximation of the triangular potential well. We can write:\n\n\\[\nV(z) = eEz \\quad z > 0 \\tag{9.35a}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV(z) = \\infty \\quad z < 0 \\tag{9.35b}\n\\]\n\nSchrodinger’s wave equation can be solved using this potential function. The quantized energy levels are shown in Figure 9.20b. Higher energy levels are usually not considered.\n\n**Figure 9.20** (a) Conduction-band edge at N-AlGaAs, n-GaAs heterojunction; (b) triangular well approximation with discrete electron energies.\n\n**Figure 9.21** Electron density in triangular potential well.\n\n**Figure 9.22** Conduction-band edge at a graded heterojunction.\n\nThe qualitative distribution of electrons in the potential well is shown in Figure 9.21. A current parallel to the interface will be a function of this electron concentration and of the electron mobility. Since the GaAs can be lightly doped or intrinsic, the two-dimensional electron gas is in a region of low impurity doping so that impurity scattering effects are minimized. The electron mobility will be much larger than if the electrons were in the same region as the ionized donors.\n\nThe movement of the electrons parallel to the interface will still be influenced by the coulomb attraction of the ionized impurities in the AlGaAs. The effect of these forces can be further reduced by using a graded AlGaAs–GaAs heterojunction. The graded layer is Al\\(_x\\)Ga\\(_{1-x}\\)As in which the mole fraction \\(x\\) varies with distance. In this case, an intrinsic layer of graded AlGaAs can be sandwiched between the N-type AlGaAs and the intrinsic GaAs. Figure 9.22 shows the conduction-band edges across a graded AlGaAs–GaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. The electrons in the potential well are further separated from the ionized impurities so that the electron mobility is increased above that in an abrupt heterojunction.\n\n### 9.3.4 Equilibrium Electrostatics\n\nWe now consider the electrostatics of the nP heterojunction that is shown in Figure 9.18. As in the case of the homojunction, potential differences exist across the space charge regions in both the n region and the P region. These potential differences correspond to the built-in potential barriers on either side of the junction. The built-in potential barrier for this ideal case is defined as shown in Figure 9.18 to be the potential difference across the vacuum level. The built-in potential barrier is the sum of the potential differences across each of the space charge regions. The heterojunction built-in potential barrier, however, is not equal to the difference between the conduction bands across the junction or the difference between the valence bands across the junction, as we defined for the homojunction.\n\nIdeally, the total built-in potential barrier \\(V_{bi}\\) can be found as the difference between the work functions, or\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = \\phi_p - \\phi_n\n\\]\n\n(9.36)\n\nEquation (9.36), from Figure 9.17, can be written as\n\n\\[\neV_{bi} = [E_{cp} + E_{fp} - (E_{fp} - E_{fn})] - [e\\chi_n + E_{fn} - (E_{fn} - E_{wn})]\n\\]\n\n(9.37a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\neV_{bi} = e(\\chi_p - \\chi_n) + (E_{cp} - E_{fp}) + (E_{fn} - E_{wn}) - (E_{fp} - E_{fn})\n\\]\n\n(9.37b)\n\nwhich can be expressed as\n\n\\[\neV_{bi} = -\\Delta E_c + \\Delta E_v + kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_{vn}}{p_{no}} \\right) - kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_{vp}}{p_{po}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.38)\n\nFinally, we can write Equation (9.38) as\n\n\\[\neV_{bi} = \\Delta E_c + kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{p_{no}}{p_{po}} \\cdot \\frac{N_{vn}}{N_{vp}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.39)\n\nwhere \\( p_{no} \\) and \\( p_{po} \\) are the hole concentrations in the P and n materials, respectively, and \\( N_{vn} \\) and \\( N_{vp} \\) are the effective density of states functions in the n and P materials, respectively. We can also obtain an expression for the built-in potential barrier in terms of the conduction band shift as\n\n\\[\neV_{bi} = -\\Delta E_c + kT \\ln \\left( \\frac{n_{no} \\cdot N_{cp}}{n_{po} \\cdot N_{cn}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.40)\n\nWe can determine the electric field and potential in the junction from Poisson’s equation in exactly the same way as we do for the homojunction. For homogeneous doping on each side of the junction, we have in the n region\n\n\\[\nE_n = \\frac{eN_d}{\\epsilon_n} (x_n + x) \\quad (-x_n \\leq x < 0) \\tag{9.41a}\n\\]\n\nand in the P region\n\n\\[\nE_p = \\frac{eN_a}{\\epsilon_p} (x_p - x) \\quad (0 < x \\leq x_p) \\tag{9.41b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\epsilon_n \\) and \\( \\epsilon_p \\) are the permittivities of the n and P materials, respectively. We may note that \\( E_n = 0 \\) at \\( x = -x_n \\), and \\( E_p = 0 \\) at \\( x = x_p \\). The electric flux density \\( D \\) is continuous across the junction, so\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_n E_n(x = 0) = \\epsilon_p E_p(x = 0) \\tag{9.42a}\n\\]\n\nwhich gives\n\n\\[\nN_d x_n = N_a x_p \\tag{9.42b}\n\\]\n\nEquation (9.42b) simply states that the net negative charge in the P region is equal to the net positive charge in the n region—the same condition we had in a pn homojunction. We are neglecting any interface states that may exist at the heterojunction.\n\nThe electric potential can be found by integrating the electric field through the space charge region so that the potential difference across each region can be determined. We find that\n\n\\[\nV_{bin} = \\frac{eN_d x_n^2}{2\\epsilon_n} \\tag{9.43a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nV_{bip} = \\frac{eN_a x_p^2}{2\\epsilon_p} \\tag{9.43b}\n\\]\n\nEquation (9.42b) can be rewritten as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x_n}{x_p} = \\frac{N_a}{N_d} \\tag{9.44}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the built-in potential barriers can then be determined as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{bin}}{V_{bip}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_p}{\\epsilon_n} \\cdot \\frac{N_a}{N_d} \\cdot \\frac{x_n^2}{x_p^2} = \\frac{\\epsilon_p N_a}{\\epsilon_n N_d} \\tag{9.45}\n\\]\n\nAssuming that \\( \\epsilon_n \\) and \\( \\epsilon_p \\) are of the same order of magnitude, the larger potential difference is across the lower-doped region.\n\nThe total built-in potential barrier is\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = V_{bi,n} + V_{bi,p} = \\frac{eN_A x_n^2}{2\\epsilon_e} + \\frac{eN_D x_p^2}{2\\epsilon_p}\n\\]\n\n(9.46)\n\nIf we solve for \\(x_n\\), for example, from Equation (9.42b) and substitute into Equation (9.46), we can solve for \\(x_n\\) as\n\n\\[\nx_n = \\left[ \\frac{2\\epsilon_e \\epsilon_p N_A V_{bi}}{eN_A(\\epsilon_e N_A + \\epsilon_p N_D)} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(9.47a)\n\nWe can also find\n\n\\[\nx_p = \\left[ \\frac{2\\epsilon_e \\epsilon_p N_D V_{bi}}{eN_D(\\epsilon_e N_A + \\epsilon_p N_D)} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(9.47b)\n\nThe total depletion width is found to be\n\n\\[\nW = x_n + x_p = \\left[ \\frac{2\\epsilon_e \\epsilon_p (N_A + N_D)^2 V_{bi}}{eN_A N_D(\\epsilon_e N_A + \\epsilon_p N_D)} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(9.48)\n\nIf a reverse-biased voltage is applied across the heterojunction, the same equations apply if \\(V_{bi}\\) is replaced by \\(V_{bi} + V_R\\). Similarly, if a forward bias is applied, the same equations also apply if \\(V_{bi}\\) is replaced by \\(V_{bi} - V_a\\). As explained earlier, \\(V_R\\) is the magnitude of the reverse-biased voltage and \\(V_a\\) is the magnitude of the forward-bias voltage.\n\nAs in the case of a homojunction, a change in depletion width with a change in junction voltage yields a junction capacitance. We can find for the nP junction\n\n\\[\nC_j' = \\left[ \\frac{eN_A N_D \\epsilon_e \\epsilon_p}{2(\\epsilon_e N_A + \\epsilon_p N_D)(V_{bi} + V_R)} \\right]^{1/2} \\quad \\text{(F/cm}^2\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n(9.49)\n\nA plot of \\(1/(C_j')^2\\) versus \\(V_R\\) again yields a straight line. The extrapolation of this plot of \\(1/(C_j')^2 = 0\\) is used to find the built-in potential barrier, \\(V_{bi}\\).\n\nFigure 9.18 shows the ideal energy-band diagram for the nP abrupt heterojunction. The experimentally determined values of \\(\\Delta E_c\\) and \\(\\Delta E_v\\) may differ from the ideal values determined using the electron affinity rule. One possible explanation for this difference is that most heterojunctions have interface states. If we assume that the electrostatic potential is continuous through the junction, then the electric flux density will be discontinuous at the heterojunction due to the surface charge trapped in the interface states. The interface states will then change the energy-band diagram of the semiconductor heterojunction just as they changed the energy-band diagram of the metal–semiconductor junction. Another possible explanation for the deviation from the ideal is that as the two materials are brought together to form the heterojunction, the electron orbitals of each material begin to interact with each other, resulting in a transition region of a few angstroms at the interface. The energy bandgap is continuous through this transition region and not a characteristic of either material. However, we still have the relation\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_c + \\Delta E_v = \\Delta E_g\n\\]\n\n(9.50)\n\nfor the straddling type of heterojunction, although the \\(\\Delta E_c\\) and \\(\\Delta E_v\\) values may differ from those determined from the electron affinity rule.\n\n**Figure 9.23** Ideal energy-band diagram of an Np heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\n\nWe may consider the general characteristics of the energy-band diagrams of the other types of heterojunction. Figure 9.23 shows the energy-band diagram of an Np heterojunction. The same \\(\\Delta E_c\\) and \\(\\Delta E_v\\) discontinuities exist, although the general shape of the conduction band, for example, is different in the nP and the Np junctions. This difference in energy bands will influence the \\(I–V\\) characteristics of the two junctions.\n\nThe other two types of heterojunctions are the nN and the pP isotype junctions. The energy-band diagram of the nN junction is shown in Figure 9.19. To achieve thermal equilibrium, electrons from the wide-bandgap material will flow into the narrow-bandgap material. A positive space charge region exists in the wide-bandgap material and an accumulation layer of electrons now exists at the interface in the narrow-bandgap material. Since there are a large number of allowed energy states in the conduction band, we expect the space charge width \\(x_n\\) and the built-in potential barrier \\(V_{bi}\\) to be small in the narrow-gap material. The energy-band diagram of the pP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 9.24. To achieve thermal equilibrium, holes from the wide-bandgap material will flow into the narrow-bandgap material, creating an accumulation layer of holes in the narrow-bandgap material at the interface. These types of isotype heterojunctions are obviously not possible in a homojunction.\n\n**Figure 9.24** Ideal energy-band diagram of a pP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### 9.3.5 Current–Voltage Characteristics\n\nThe ideal current–voltage characteristics of a pn homojunction have been developed in Chapter 8. Since the energy-band diagram of a heterojunction is more complicated than that of a homojunction, we would expect the I–V characteristics of the two junctions to differ.\n\nOne immediate difference between a homojunction and a heterojunction is in the barrier heights seen by the electrons and holes. Since the built-in potential barrier for electrons and holes in a homojunction is the same, the relative magnitude of the electron and hole currents is determined by the relative doping levels. In a heterojunction, the barrier heights seen by electrons and holes are not the same. The energy-band diagrams in Figures 9.18 and 9.23 demonstrate that the barrier heights for electrons and holes in a heterojunction can be significantly different. The barrier height for electrons in Figure 9.18 is larger than that for holes, so we would expect the current due to electrons to be insignificant compared to the hole current. If the barrier height for electrons is 0.2 eV larger than that for holes, the electron current will be approximately a factor of 10⁴ smaller than the hole current, assuming all other parameters are equal. The opposite situation exists for the band diagram shown in Figure 9.23.\n\nThe conduction-band edge in Figure 9.23 and the valence-band edge in Figure 9.18 are somewhat similar to that of a rectifying metal–semiconductor contact. We derive the current–voltage characteristics of a heterojunction, in general, on the basis of thermionic emission of carriers over the barrier, as we do in the case of metal–semiconductor junction. We can then write\n\n\\[\nJ = A^* T^2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{E_v}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(9.51)\n\nwhere \\( E_v \\) is an effective barrier height. The barrier height can be increased or reduced by an applied potential across the junction as in the case of a pn homojunction or a Schottky barrier junction. The heterojunction I–V characteristics, however, may need to be modified to include diffusion effects and tunneling effects. Another complicating factor is that the effective mass of a carrier changes from one side of the junction to the other. Although the actual derivation of the I–V relationship of the heterojunction is complex, the general form of the I–V equation is still similar to that of a Schottky barrier diode and is generally dominated by one type of carrier.",

    "text": "## 9.4 | SUMMARY\n\n- A metal on a lightly doped semiconductor can produce a rectifying contact that is known as a Schottky barrier diode. The ideal barrier height between the metal and semiconductor is the difference between the metal work function and the semiconductor electron affinity.\n- When a positive voltage is applied to an n-type semiconductor with respect to the metal (reverse bias), the barrier between the semiconductor and metal increases so that there is essentially no flow of charged carriers. When a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to an n-type semiconductor (forward bias), the barrier between the semiconductor and metal is lowered so that electrons can easily flow from the semiconductor into the metal by a process called thermionic emission.\n- The ideal current–voltage relationship of the Schottky barrier diode is the same as that of the pn junction diode. However, since the current mechanism is different from that of the pn junction diode, the switching speed of the Schottky diode is faster. In addition, the reverse saturation current of the Schottky diode is larger than that of the pn junction diode, so a Schottky diode requires less forward bias voltage to achieve a given current compared to a pn junction diode.\n- Metal–semiconductor junctions can also form ohmic contacts, which are low-resistance junctions providing conduction in both directions with very little voltage drop across the junction.\n- Semiconductor heterojunctions are formed between two semiconductor materials with different bandgap energies. One useful property of a heterojunction is the creation of a potential well at the interface. Electrons are confined to the potential well in the direction perpendicular to the interface, but are free to move in the other two directions.",

    "text": "## 3.1 Allowed and Forbidden Energy Bands\n\nIn the last chapter, we considered the one-electron, or hydrogen, atom. That analysis showed that the energy of the bound electron is quantized: Only discrete values of electron energy are allowed. The radial probability density for the electron was also determined. This function gives the probability of finding the electron at a particular distance from the nucleus and shows that the electron is not localized at a given radius. We can extrapolate these single-atom results to a crystal and qualitatively derive the concepts of allowed and forbidden energy bands. We will then apply quantum mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave equation to the problem of an electron in a single crystal. We find that the electronic energy states occur in bands of allowed states that are separated by forbidden energy bands.\n\n### 3.1.1 Formation of Energy Bands\n\nFigure 3.1a shows the radial probability density function for the lowest electron energy state of the single, noninteracting hydrogen atom, and Figure 3.1b shows the same probability curves for two atoms that are in close proximity to each other. The wave functions of the electrons of the two atoms overlap, which means that the two electrons will interact. This interaction or perturbation results in the discrete quantized energy level splitting into two discrete energy levels, schematically shown in Figure 3.1c. The splitting of the discrete state into two states is consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nA simple analogy of the splitting of energy levels by interacting particles is the following. Two identical race cars and drivers are far apart on a race track. There is no interaction between the cars, so they both must provide the same power to achieve a given speed. However, if one car pulls up close behind the other car, there is an interaction called draft. The second car will be pulled to an extent by the lead car. The lead car will therefore require more power to achieve the same speed since it is pulling the second car, and the second car will require less power since it is being pulled by the lead car. So there is a “splitting” of power (energy) of the two interacting race cars. (Keep in mind not to take analogies too literally.)\n\n**Figure 3.1** (a) Probability density function of an isolated hydrogen atom. (b) Overlapping probability density functions of two adjacent hydrogen atoms. (c) The splitting of the \\( n = 1 \\) state.\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n| (a) | (b) | (c) |\n| \\( p(r) \\) | \\( p(r) \\) | \\( p(r) \\) |\n| \\( r \\) | \\( d_0 \\) | \\( d_0 \\) |\n|   |   | Electron energy |\n|   |   | \\( n = 1 \\) |\n|   |   | \\( n = 1 \\) |\n\n\n**Figure 3.2** The splitting of an energy state into a band of allowed energies.\n\nNow, if we somehow start with a regular periodic arrangement of hydrogen-type atoms that are initially very far apart, and begin pushing the atoms together, the initial quantized energy level will split into a band of discrete energy levels. This effect is shown schematically in Figure 3.2, where the parameter \\( r_0 \\) represents the equilibrium interatomic distance in the crystal. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, there is a band of allowed energies, but within the allowed band, the energies are at discrete levels. The Pauli exclusion principle states that the joining of atoms to form a system (crystal) does not alter the total number of quantum states regardless of size. However, since no two electrons can have the same quantum number, the discrete energy must split into a band of energies in order that each electron can occupy a distinct quantum state.\n\nWe have seen previously that, at any energy level, the number of allowed quantum states is relatively small. In order to accommodate all of the electrons in a crystal, we must have many energy levels within the allowed band. As an example, suppose that we have a system with \\( 10^9 \\) one-electron atoms and also suppose that, at the equilibrium interatomic distance, the width of the allowed energy band is 1 eV. For simplicity, we assume that each electron in the system occupies a different energy level and, if the discrete energy states are equidistant, then the energy levels are separated by \\( 10^{-9} \\) eV. This energy difference is extremely small, so that for all practical purposes, we have a quasi-continuous energy distribution through the allowed energy band. The fact that \\( 10^{-9} \\) eV is a very small difference between two energy states can be seen from the following example.\n\nConsider again a regular periodic arrangement of atoms, in which each atom now contains more than one electron. Suppose the atom in this imaginary crystal contains electrons up through the \\(n = 3\\) energy level. If the atoms are initially very far apart, the electrons in adjacent atoms will not interact and will occupy the discrete energy levels. If these atoms are brought closer together, the outermost electrons in the \\(n = 3\\) energy shell will begin to interact initially, so that this discrete energy level will split into a band of allowed energies. If the atoms continue to move closer together, the electrons in the \\(n = 2\\) shell may begin to interact and will also split into a band of allowed energies. Finally, if the atoms become sufficiently close together, the innermost electrons in the \\(n = 1\\) level may interact, so that this energy level may also split into a band of allowed energies. The splitting of these discrete energy levels is qualitatively shown in Figure 3.3. If the equilibrium interatomic distance is \\(r_0\\), then we have bands of allowed energies that the electrons may occupy separated by bands of forbidden energies. This energy-band splitting and the formation of allowed and forbidden bands is the energy-band theory of single-crystal materials.\n\nThe actual band splitting in a crystal is much more complicated than indicated in Figure 3.3. A schematic representation of an isolated silicon atom is shown in Figure 3.4a. Ten of the 14 silicon atom electrons occupy deep-lying energy levels close to the nucleus. The four remaining valence electrons are relatively weakly bound and are the electrons involved in chemical reactions. Figure 3.4b shows the band splitting of silicon. We need only consider the \\(n = 3\\) level for the valence.\n\n**Figure 3.3** Schematic showing the splitting of three energy states into allowed bands of energies.\n\n**Figure 3.4** (a) Schematic of an isolated silicon atom. (b) The splitting of the 3s and 3p states of silicon into the allowed and forbidden energy bands.  \n*(From Shockley [6].)*\n\nElectrons, since the first two energy shells are completely full and are tightly bound to the nucleus. The 3s state corresponds to \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( l = 0 \\) and contains two quantum states per atom. This state will contain two electrons at \\( T = 0 \\) K. The 3p state corresponds to \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( l = 1 \\) and contains six quantum states per atom. This state will contain the remaining two electrons in the individual silicon atom.\n\nAs the interatomic distance decreases, the 3s and 3p states interact and overlap. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, the bands have again split, but now four quantum states per atom are in the lower band and four quantum states per atom are in the upper band. At absolute zero degrees, electrons are in the lowest energy state, so that all states in the lower band (the valence band) will be full and all states in the upper band (the conduction band) will be empty. The bandgap energy \\( E_g \\) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band is the width of the forbidden energy band.\n\nWe have discussed qualitatively how and why bands of allowed and forbidden energies are formed in a crystal. The formation of these energy bands is directly related to the electrical characteristics of the crystal, as we will see later in our discussion.\n\n### 3.1.2 The Kronig–Penney Model\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed qualitatively the splitting of allowed electron energies as atoms are brought together to form a crystal. The concept of allowed and forbidden energy bands can be developed more rigorously by considering quantum mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave equation. It may be easy for the reader to “get lost” in the following derivation, but the result forms the basis for the energy-band theory of semiconductors.\n\nThe potential function of a single, noninteracting, one-electron atom is shown in Figure 3.5a. Also indicated on the figure are the discrete energy levels allowed for the electron. Figure 3.5b shows the same type of potential function for the case when several atoms in close proximity are arranged in a one-dimensional array. The potential functions of adjacent atoms overlap, and the net potential function for this case is shown in Figure 3.5c. It is this potential function we would need to use in Schrödinger’s wave equation to model a one-dimensional single-crystal material.\n\nThe solution to Schrödinger’s wave equation, for this one-dimensional single-crystal lattice, is made more tractable by considering a simpler potential function. Figure 3.6 is the one-dimensional Kronig–Penney model of the periodic potential function, which is used to represent a one-dimensional single-crystal lattice. We need to solve Schrödinger’s wave equation in each region. As with previous quantum mechanical problems, the more interesting solution occurs for the case when \\( E < V_0 \\), which corresponds to a particle being bound within the crystal. The electrons are contained in the potential wells, but we have the possibility of tunneling between wells. The Kronig–Penney model is an idealized periodic potential representing a one-dimensional single crystal, but the results will illustrate many of the important features of the quantum behavior of electrons in a periodic lattice.\n\nTo obtain the solution to Schrödinger’s wave equation, we make use of a mathematical theorem by Bloch. The theorem states that all one-electron wave functions, for problems involving periodically varying potential energy functions, must be of the form\n\n\\[\n\\psi(x) = u(x)e^{j k x}\n\\]\n\n(3.1)\n\n\n*Indicates sections that will aid in the total summation of understanding of semiconductor devices, but may be skipped the first time through the text without loss of continuity.\n\n\\(^1\\)Other techniques, such as the nearly free electron model, can be used to predict the energy-band theory of semiconductor materials. See, for example, Kittel [3] or Wolfe et al. [14].\n\n**Figure 3.5** \n- (a) Potential function of a single isolated atom.\n- (b) Overlapping potential functions of adjacent atoms.\n- (c) Net potential function of a one-dimensional single crystal.\n\n\n**Figure 3.6** \nThe one-dimensional periodic potential function of the Kronig–Penney model.\n\n- **(a)**: Shows the potential function \\( V(x) \\) for a single atom with energy levels \\( E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4 \\).\n- **(b)**: Illustrates overlapping potential functions for multiple atoms.\n- **(c)**: Depicts the net potential function for a one-dimensional crystal.\n\nThe potential function \\( V(x) \\) is shown with periodic barriers and wells, representing the Kronig–Penney model. The potential is periodic with intervals \\( -a-b \\) to \\( a+b \\), with potential \\( V_0 \\) in the barriers.\n\nThe parameter \\( k \\) is called a constant of motion and will be considered in more detail as we develop the theory. The function \\( u(x) \\) is a periodic function with period \\( (a + b) \\).\n\nWe stated in Chapter 2 that the total solution to the wave equation is the product of the time-independent solution and the time-dependent solution, or\n\n\\[\n\\Psi(x, t) = \\psi(x)\\phi(t) = u(x)e^{ikx} \\cdot e^{-iEt/\\hbar}\n\\]\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhich may be written as\n\n\\[\n\\Psi(x, t) = u(x)e^{i(kx-Et/\\hbar)}\n\\]\n\n(3.3)\n\nThis traveling-wave solution represents the motion of an electron in a single-crystal material. The amplitude of the traveling wave is a periodic function and the parameter \\( k \\) is also referred to as a wave number.\n\nWe can now begin to determine a relation between the parameter \\( k \\), the total energy \\( E \\), and the potential \\( V_0 \\). If we consider region I in Figure 3.6 (0 < x < a) in which \\( V(x) = 0 \\), take the second derivative of Equation (3.1), and substitute this result into the time-independent Schrödinger’s wave equation given by Equation (2.13), we obtain the relation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2u(x)}{dx^2} + 2ijk \\frac{du(x)}{dx} - (k^2 - \\alpha^2)u(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe function \\( u_1(x) \\) is the amplitude of the wave function in region I and the parameter \\( \\alpha \\) is defined as\n\n\\[\n\\alpha^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\n\\]\n\n(3.5)\n\nConsider now a specific region II, \\(-b < x < 0\\), in which \\( V(x) = V_0 \\), and apply Schrödinger’s wave equation. We obtain the relation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2u(x)}{dx^2} + 2ijk \\frac{du(x)}{dx} - \\left[k^2 - \\frac{2mV_0}{\\hbar^2}\\right]u(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere \\( u_2(x) \\) is the amplitude of the wave function in region II. We may define\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(E - V_0) = \\alpha^2 - \\frac{2mV_0}{\\hbar^2} = \\beta^2\n\\]\n\n(3.7)\n\nso that Equation (3.6) may be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2u(x)}{dx^2} + 2ijk \\frac{du(x)}{dx} - (k^2 - \\beta^2)u(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.8)\n\nNote that from Equation (3.7), if \\( E \\geq V_0 \\), the parameter \\( \\beta \\) is real, whereas if \\( E < V_0 \\), then \\( \\beta \\) is imaginary.\n\nThe solution to Equation (3.4), for region I, is of the form\n\n\\[\nu_1(x) = Ae^{\\alpha x} + Be^{-\\alpha x} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad (0 < x < a)\n\\]\n\n(3.9)\n\nand the solution to Equation (3.8), for region II, is of the form\n\n\\[\nu_2(x) = Ce^{\\beta x} + De^{-\\beta x} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad (-b < x < 0)\n\\]\n\n(3.10)\n\n\nSince the potential function \\( V(x) \\) is everywhere finite, both the wave function \\( \\psi(x) \\) and its first derivative \\( \\partial \\psi(x)/\\partial x \\) must be continuous. This continuity condition implies that the wave amplitude function \\( u(x) \\) and its first derivative \\( \\partial u(x)/\\partial x \\) must also be continuous.\n\nIf we consider the boundary at \\( x = 0 \\) and apply the continuity condition to the wave amplitude, we have\n\n\\[\nu_1(0) = u_2(0)\n\\]\n\n(3.11)\n\nSubstituting Equations (3.9) and (3.10) into Equation (3.11), we obtain\n\n\\[\nA + B = C - D = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.12)\n\nNow applying the condition that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{du_1}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\frac{du_2}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0}\n\\]\n\n(3.13)\n\nwe obtain\n\n\\[\n(\\alpha - k)A - (\\alpha + k)B = (\\beta - K)C + (\\beta + K)D = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.14)\n\nWe have considered region I as \\( 0 < x < a \\) and region II as \\(-b < x < 0\\). The periodicity and the continuity condition mean that the function \\( u_1 \\), as \\( x \\to a \\), is equal to the function \\( u_2 \\), as \\( x \\to -b \\). This condition may be written as\n\n\\[\nu_1(a) = u_2(-b)\n\\]\n\n(3.15)\n\nApplying the solutions for \\( u_1(x) \\) and \\( u_2(x) \\) to the boundary condition in Equation (3.15) yields\n\n\\[\nAe^{\\alpha a} + Be^{-\\alpha a} = Ce^{\\beta b} - De^{-\\beta b} = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.16)\n\nThe last boundary condition is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{du_1}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=a} = \\frac{du_2}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=-b}\n\\]\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhich gives\n\n\\[\n(\\alpha - k)Ae^{\\alpha a} - (\\alpha + k)Be^{-\\alpha a} = (\\beta - K)Ce^{\\beta b} + (\\beta + K)De^{-\\beta b} = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.18)\n\nWe now have four homogeneous equations, Equations (3.12), (3.14), (3.16), and (3.18), with four unknowns as a result of applying the four boundary conditions. In a set of simultaneous, linear, homogeneous equations, there is a nontrivial solution if, and only if, the determinant of the coefficients is zero. In our case, the coefficients in question are the coefficients of the parameters \\( A, B, C, \\) and \\( D \\).\n\nThe evaluation of this determinant is extremely laborious and will not be considered in detail. The result is\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{(\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2)}{2\\alpha \\beta} (\\sin \\alpha a \\sin \\beta b) + (\\cos \\alpha a \\cos \\beta b) = \\cos k(a + b)\n\\]\n\n(3.19)\n\n\nEquation (3.19) relates the parameter \\( k \\) to the total energy \\( E \\) (through the parameter \\( \\alpha \\)) and the potential function \\( V_0 \\) (through the parameter \\( \\beta \\)).\n\nAs we mentioned, the more interesting solutions occur for \\( E < V_0 \\), which applies to the electron bound within the crystal. From Equation (3.7), the parameter \\( \\beta \\) is then an imaginary quantity. We may define\n\n\\[\n\\beta = j\\gamma\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma \\) is a real quantity. Equation (3.19) can be written in terms of \\( \\gamma \\) as\n\n\\[\n\\gamma^2 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\alpha\\gamma} (\\sin \\alpha a)(\\sinh \\gamma b) + (\\cos \\alpha a)(\\cosh \\gamma b) = \\cos k(a + b)\n\\]\n\nEquation (3.21) does not lend itself to an analytical solution, but must be solved using numerical or graphical techniques to obtain the relation between \\( k, E, \\) and \\( V_0 \\).\n\nThe solution of Schrödinger’s wave equation for a single bound particle resulted in discrete allowed energies. The solution of Equation (3.21) will result in a band of allowed energies.\n\nTo obtain an equation that is more susceptible to a graphical solution and thus will illustrate the nature of the results, let the potential barrier width \\( b \\rightarrow 0 \\) and the barrier height \\( V_0 \\rightarrow \\infty \\), but such that the product \\( bV_0 \\) remains finite. Equation (3.21) then reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{mV_0ba}{\\hbar^2} \\right) \\frac{\\sin \\alpha a}{\\alpha a} + \\cos \\alpha a = \\cos ka\n\\]\n\nWe may define a parameter \\( P' \\) as\n\n\\[\nP' = \\frac{mV_0ba}{\\hbar^2}\n\\]\n\nThen, finally, we have the relation\n\n\\[\nP' \\frac{\\sin \\alpha a}{\\alpha a} + \\cos \\alpha a = \\cos ka\n\\]\n\nEquation (3.24) again gives the relation between the parameter \\( k \\), total energy \\( E \\) (through the parameter \\( \\alpha \\)), and the potential barrier \\( bV_0 \\). We may note that Equation (3.24) is not a solution of Schrödinger’s wave equation but gives the conditions for which Schrödinger’s wave equation will have a solution. If we assume that the crystal is infinitely large, then \\( k \\) in Equation (3.24) can assume a continuum of values and must be real.\n\n### 3.1.3 The k-Space Diagram\n\nTo begin to understand the nature of the solution, initially consider the special case for which \\( V_0 = 0 \\). In this case \\( P' = 0 \\), which corresponds to a free particle since there are no potential barriers. From Equation (3.24), we have that\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\alpha a = \\cos ka\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = k\n\\]\n\n\n*Figure 3.7 | The parabolic \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) curve for the free electron.*\n\nSince the potential is equal to zero, the total energy \\( E \\) is equal to the kinetic energy, so that, from Equation (3.5), Equation (3.26) may be written as\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m\\left(\\frac{mv^2}{2}\\right)}{\\hbar^2}} = \\frac{p}{\\hbar} = k\n\\]\n\n(3.27)\n\nwhere \\( p \\) is the particle momentum. The constant of the motion parameter \\( k \\) is related to the particle momentum for the free electron. The parameter \\( k \\) is also referred to as a wave number.\n\nWe can also relate the energy and momentum as\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{p^2}{2m} = \\frac{k^2\\hbar^2}{2m}\n\\]\n\n(3.28)\n\nFigure 3.7 shows the parabolic relation of Equation (3.28) between the energy \\( E \\) and momentum \\( p \\) for the free particle. Since the momentum and wave number are linearly related, Figure 3.7 is also the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) curve for the particle.\n\nWe now want to consider the relation between \\( E \\) and \\( k \\) from Equation (3.24) for the particle in the single-crystal lattice. As the parameter \\( P' \\) increases, the particle becomes more tightly bound to the potential well or atom. We may define the left side of Equation (3.24) to be a function \\( f(\\alpha a) \\), so that\n\n\\[\nf(\\alpha a) = P' \\frac{\\sin \\alpha a}{\\alpha a} + \\cos \\alpha a\n\\]\n\n(3.29)\n\nFigure 3.8a is a plot of the first term of Equation (3.29) versus \\( \\alpha a \\). Figure 3.8b shows a plot of the \\( \\cos \\alpha a \\) term and Figure 3.8c is the sum of the two terms, or \\( f(\\alpha a) \\).\n\nNow from Equation (3.24), we also have that\n\n\\[\nf(\\alpha a) = \\cos ka\n\\]\n\n(3.30)\n\nFor Equation (3.30) to be valid, the allowed values of the \\( f(\\alpha a) \\) function must be bounded between \\( +1 \\) and \\( -1 \\). Figure 3.8c shows the allowed values of \\( f(\\alpha a) \\) and the allowed values of \\( \\alpha a \\) in the shaded areas. Also shown on the figure are the values of \\( ka \\) from the right side of Equation (3.30), which correspond to the allowed values of \\( f(\\alpha a) \\).\n\n**Figure 3.8** A plot of (a) the first term in Equation (3.29), (b) the second term in Equation (3.29), and (c) the entire \\( f(\\alpha a) \\) function. The shaded areas show the allowed values of \\( (\\alpha a) \\) corresponding to real values of \\( k \\).\n\nThe parameter \\( \\alpha \\) is related to the total energy \\( E \\) of the particle through Equation (3.5), which is \\( \\alpha^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} \\). A plot of the energy \\( E \\) of the particle as a function of the wave number \\( k \\) can be generated from Figure 3.8c. **Figure 3.9 shows this plot and thus shows the concept of allowed energy bands for the particle propagating in the crystal lattice.** Since the energy \\( E \\) has discontinuities, we also have the concept of forbidden energies for the particles in the crystal.\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is a positive integer. We may consider Figure 3.9 and displace portions of the curve by \\(2\\pi\\). Mathematically, Equation (3.24) is still satisfied. Figure 3.10 shows how various segments of the curve can be displaced by the \\(2\\pi\\) factor. Figure 3.11 shows the case in which the entire \\(E\\) versus \\(k\\) plot is contained within \\(-\\pi/a < k < \\pi/a\\). This plot is referred to as a reduced \\(k\\)-space diagram, or a reduced-zone representation.\n\nWe noted in Equation (3.27) that for a free electron, the particle momentum and the wave number \\(k\\) are related by \\(p = \\hbar k\\). Given the similarity between the free electron solution and the results of the single crystal shown in Figure 3.9, the parameter \\(\\hbar k\\) in a single crystal is referred to as the crystal momentum. This parameter is not the actual momentum of the electron in the crystal but is a constant of the motion that includes the crystal interaction.\n\n\n**Figure 3.10** The \\(E\\) versus \\(k\\) diagram showing \\(2\\pi\\) displacements of several sections of allowed energy bands.\n\n\n**Figure 3.11** The \\(E\\) versus \\(k\\) diagram in the reduced-zone representation.\n\nWe have been considering the Kronig–Penney model, which is a one-dimensional periodic potential function used to model a single-crystal lattice. The principal result of this analysis, so far, is that electrons in the crystal occupy certain allowed energy bands and are excluded from the forbidden energy bands. For real three-dimensional single-crystal materials, a similar energy-band theory exists. We will obtain additional electron properties from the Kronig–Penney model in the next sections.",

All of the valence electrons schematically shown in Figure 3.12 are in the valence band. The upper energy band, the conduction band, is completely empty at \\(T = 0 \\, K\\).\n\nAs the temperature increases above \\(0 \\, K\\), a few valence band electrons may gain enough thermal energy to break the covalent bond and jump into the conduction band. Figure 3.13a shows a two-dimensional representation of this bond-breaking process.\n\n**Figure 3.12** | Two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in a semiconductor at \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n\n**Figure 3.13**  \n(a) Two-dimensional representation of the breaking of a covalent bond.  \n(b) Corresponding line representation of the energy band and the generation of a negative and positive charge with the breaking of a covalent bond.\n\nThe semiconductor is neutrally charged. This means that, as the negatively charged electron breaks away from its covalent bonding position, a positively charged \"empty state\" is created in the original covalent bonding position in the valence band. As the temperature further increases, more covalent bonds are broken, more electrons jump to the conduction band, and more positive \"empty states\" are created in the valence band.\n\nWe can also relate this bond breaking to the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) energy bands. **Figure 3.14a** shows the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram of the conduction and valence bands at \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\). The energy states in the valence band are completely full and the states in the conduction band are empty. **Figure 3.14b** shows these same bands for \\( T > 0 \\, \\text{K} \\), in which some electrons have gained enough energy to jump to the conduction band and have left empty states in the valence band. We are assuming at this point that no external forces are applied so the electron and \"empty state\" distributions are symmetrical with \\( k \\).\n\n**Figure 3.14** The \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram of the conduction and valence bands of a semiconductor at (a) \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\) and (b) \\( T > 0 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n\n### 3.2.2 Drift Current\n\nCurrent is due to the net flow of charge. If we had a collection of positively charged ions with a volume density \\( N \\, (\\text{cm}^{-3}) \\) and an average drift velocity \\( v_d \\, (\\text{cm/s}) \\), then the drift current density would be\n\n\\[\nJ = qNv_d \\quad \\text{A/cm}^2\n\\]\n\n(3.32)\n\nIf, instead of considering the average drift velocity, we considered the individual ion velocities, then we could write the drift current density as\n\n\\[\nJ = q \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} v_i\n\\]\n\n(3.33)\n\nwhere \\( v_i \\) is the velocity of the \\( i \\)th ion. The summation in Equation (3.33) is taken over a unit volume so that the current density \\( J \\) is still in units of A/cm\\(^2\\).\n\nSince electrons are charged particles, a net drift of electrons in the conduction band will give rise to a current. The electron distribution in the conduction band, as shown in Figure 3.14b, is an even function of \\( k \\) when no external force is applied. Recall that \\( k \\) for a free electron is related to momentum so that, since there are as many electrons with a \\( +|k| \\) value as there are with a \\( -|k| \\) value, the net drift current density due to these electrons is zero. This result is certainly expected since there is no externally applied force.\n\nIf a force is applied to a particle and the particle moves, it must gain energy. This effect is expressed as\n\n\\[\ndE = F \\, dx = F \\, v \\, dt\n\\]\n\n(3.34)\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the applied force, \\( dx \\) is the differential distance the particle moves, \\( v \\) is the velocity, and \\( dE \\) is the increase in energy. If an external force is applied to the electrons in the conduction band, there are empty energy states into which the electrons can move; therefore, because of the external force, electrons can gain energy and a\n\n*Figure 3.15 | The asymmetric distribution of electrons in the E versus k diagram when an external force is applied.*\n\nThe electron distribution in the conduction band may look like that shown in Figure 3.15, which implies that the electrons have gained a net momentum.\n\nWe may write the drift current density due to the motion of electrons as\n\n\\[\nJ = -e \\sum_{i} n_i v_i\n\\]\n\n(3.35)\n\nwhere \\( e \\) is the magnitude of the electronic charge and \\( n \\) is the number of electrons per unit volume in the conduction band. Again, the summation is taken over a unit volume so that the current density is still in units of A/cm\\(^2\\). We may note from Equation (3.35) that the current is directly related to the electron velocity; that is, the current is related to how well the electron can move in the crystal.\n\n### 3.2.3 Electron Effective Mass\n\nThe movement of an electron in a lattice will, in general, be different from that of an electron in free space. In addition to an externally applied force, there are internal forces in the crystal due to positively charged ions or protons and negatively charged electrons, which will influence the motion of electrons in the lattice. We can write\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{ext}} + F_{\\text{int}} = ma\n\\]\n\n(3.36)\n\nwhere \\( F_{\\text{total}}, F_{\\text{ext}}, \\) and \\( F_{\\text{int}} \\) are the total force, the externally applied force, and the internal forces, respectively, acting on a particle in a crystal. The parameter \\( a \\) is the acceleration and \\( m \\) is the rest mass of the particle.\n\nSince it is difficult to take into account all of the internal forces, we will write the equation\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{ext}} = m^* a\n\\]\n\n(3.37)\n\nwhere the acceleration \\( a \\) is now directly related to the external force. The parameter \\( m^* \\), called the effective mass, takes into account the particle mass and also takes into account the effect of the internal forces.\n\nTo use an analogy for the effective mass concept, consider the difference in motion between a glass marble in a container filled with water and in a container filled with oil. In general, the marble will drop through the water at a faster rate than through the oil. The external force in this example is the gravitational force and the internal forces are related to the viscosity of the liquids. Because of the difference in motion of the marble in these two cases, the mass of the marble would appear to be different in water than in oil. (As with any analogy, we must be careful not to be too literal.)\n\nWe can also relate the effective mass of an electron in a crystal to the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) curves, such as is shown in Figure 3.11. In a semiconductor material, we will be dealing with allowed energy bands that are almost empty of electrons and other energy bands that are almost full of electrons.\n\nTo begin, consider the case of a free electron whose \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) curve is shown in Figure 3.7. Recalling Equation (3.28), the energy and momentum are related by\n\n\\[\nE = p^2/2m = \\hbar^2 k^2/2m\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the electron. The momentum and wave number \\( k \\) are related by \\( p = \\hbar k \\). If we take the derivative of Equation (3.28) with respect to \\( k \\), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m} = \\frac{\\hbar p}{m}\n\\]\n\nRelating momentum to velocity, Equation (3.38) can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{p}{m} = v\n\\]\n\n(3.39)\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle. The first derivative of \\( E \\) with respect to \\( k \\) is related to the velocity of the particle.\n\nIf we now take the second derivative of \\( E \\) with respect to \\( k \\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m}\n\\]\n\n(3.40)\n\nWe may rewrite Equation (3.40) as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{1}{m}\n\\]\n\n(3.41)\n\nThe second derivative of \\( E \\) with respect to \\( k \\) is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle. For the case of a free electron, the mass is a constant (nonrelativistic effect), so the second derivative function is a constant. We may also note from Figure 3.7 that \\( d^2E/dk^2 \\) is a positive quantity, which implies that the mass of the electron is also a positive quantity.\n\nIf we apply an electric field to the free electron and use Newton’s classical equation of motion, we can write\n\n\\[\nF = ma = -eE\n\\]\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the acceleration, \\( E \\) is the applied electric field, and \\( e \\) is the magnitude of the electronic charge. Solving for the acceleration, we have\n\n\\[\na = -\\frac{eE}{m}\n\\]\n\n(3.43)\n\nThe motion of the free electron is in the opposite direction to the applied electric field because of the negative charge.\n\nWe may now apply the results to the electron in the bottom of an allowed energy band. Consider the allowed energy band in Figure 3.16a. The energy near the bottom...\n\n**Figure 3.16** (a) The conduction band in reduced \\( k \\) space, and the parabolic approximation. (b) The valence band in reduced \\( k \\) space, and the parabolic approximation.\n\n\nThe energy band may be approximated by a parabola, just as that of a free particle. We may write\n\n\\[\nE - E_c = C_1 k^2\n\\]\n\n(3.44)\n\nThe energy \\( E_c \\) is the energy at the bottom of the band. Since \\( E > E_c \\), the parameter \\( C_1 \\) is a positive quantity.\n\nTaking the second derivative of \\( E \\) with respect to \\( k \\) from Equation (3.44), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = 2C_1\n\\]\n\n(3.45)\n\nWe may put Equation (3.45) in the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{2C_1}{\\hbar^2}\n\\]\n\n(3.46)\n\nComparing Equation (3.46) with Equation (3.41), we may equate \\( \\hbar^2/2C_1 \\) to the mass of the particle. However, the curvature of the curve in Figure 3.16a will not, in general, be the same as the curvature of the free-particle curve. We may write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{2C_1}{\\hbar^2} = \\frac{1}{m^*}\n\\]\n\n(3.47)\n\nwhere \\( m^* \\) is called the effective mass. Since \\( C_1 > 0 \\), we have that \\( m^* > 0 \\) also.\n\nThe effective mass is a parameter that relates the quantum mechanical results to the classical force equations. In most instances, the electron in the bottom of the conduction band can be thought of as a classical particle whose motion can be modeled by Newtonian mechanics, provided that the internal forces and quantum mechanical properties are taken into account through the effective mass. If we apply an electric field to the electron in the bottom of the allowed energy band, we may write the acceleration as\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-eE}{m^*_e}\n\\]\n\n(3.48)\n\nwhere \\( m^*_e \\) is the effective mass of the electron. The effective mass \\( m^*_e \\) of the electron near the bottom of the conduction band is a constant.\n\n### 3.2.4 Concept of the Hole\n\nIn considering the two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding shown in Figure 3.13a, a positively charged “empty state” was created when a valence electron was elevated into the conduction band. For \\( T > 0 \\, \\text{K} \\), all valence electrons may gain thermal energy; if a valence electron gains a small amount of thermal energy, it may hop into the empty state. **The movement of a valence electron into the empty state is equivalent to the movement of the positively charged empty state itself.** Figure 3.17 shows the movement of valence electrons in the crystal, alternately filling one empty state and creating a new empty state—a motion equivalent to a positive charge moving in the valence band. The crystal now has a second equally important charge carrier that can give rise to a current. This charge carrier is called a **hole** and, as we will see, can also be thought of as a classical particle whose motion can be modeled using Newtonian mechanics.\n\nThe drift current density due to electrons in the valence band, such as shown in Figure 3.14b, can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ = -e \\sum_{i \\, ( \\text{filled} )} v_i\n\\]\n\n(3.49)\n\nwhere the summation extends over all filled states. This summation is inconvenient since it extends over a nearly full valence band and takes into account a very large number of states. We may rewrite Equation (3.49) in the form\n\n\\[\nJ = -e \\sum_{i \\, ( \\text{debit} )} v_i + e \\sum_{i \\, ( \\text{empty} )} v_i\n\\]\n\n(3.50)\n\nIf we consider a band that is totally full, all available states are occupied by electrons. The individual electrons can be thought of as moving with a velocity as given by Equation (3.39):\n\n\\[\nv(E) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\right) \\frac{dE}{dk}\n\\]\n\n(3.39)\n\n**The band is symmetric in \\( k \\) and each state is occupied so that, for every electron with a velocity \\( |v| \\), there is a corresponding electron with a velocity \\( -|v| \\).** Since the band is full, the distribution of electrons with respect to \\( k \\) cannot be changed with an\n\n\n**Figure 3.17** Visualization of the movement of a hole in a semiconductor.\n\n**Figure 3.18** (a) Valence band with conventional electron-filled states and empty states. (b) Concept of positive charges occupying the original empty states.\n\nThe net drift current density generated from a completely full band, then, is zero, or\n\n\\[\n-e \\sum_{i \\, (occ)} v_i = 0\n\\]\n\n(3.51)\n\nWe can now write the drift current density from Equation (3.50) for an almost full band as\n\n\\[\nJ = +e \\sum_{i \\, (empty)} v_i\n\\]\n\n(3.52)\n\nwhere the \\( v_i \\) in the summation is the\n\n\\[\nv(E) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\right) \\frac{dE}{dk}\n\\]\n\nassociated with the empty state. Equation (3.52) is entirely equivalent to placing a positively charged particle in the empty states and assuming all other states in the band are empty, or neutrally charged. This concept is shown in Figure 3.18. Figure 3.18a shows the valence band with the conventional electron-filled states and empty states, whereas Figure 3.18b shows the new concept of positive charges occupying the original empty states. This concept is consistent with the discussion of the positively charged \"empty state\" in the valence band, as shown in Figure 3.17.\n\nThe \\( v_i \\) in the summation of Equation (3.52) is related to how well this positively charged particle moves in the semiconductor. Now consider an electron near the top of the allowed energy band shown in Figure 3.16b. The energy near the top of the allowed energy band may again be approximated by a parabola so that we may write\n\n\\[\n(E - E_s) = -C(k)^2\n\\]\n\n(3.53)\n\nThe energy \\( E_s \\) is the energy at the top of the energy band. Since \\( E < E_s \\) for electrons in this band, the parameter \\( C \\) must be a positive quantity.\n\nTaking the second derivative of \\( E \\) with respect to \\( k \\) from Equation (3.53), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = -2C\n\\]\n\n(3.54)\n\nWe may rearrange this equation so that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{-2C}{\\hbar^2}\n\\]\n\n(3.55)\n\nComparing Equation (3.55) with Equation (3.41), we may write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2 E}{dk^2} = -\\frac{2C_2}{\\hbar^2} = \\frac{1}{m^*}\n\\]\n\n(3.56)\n\nwhere \\( m^* \\) is again an effective mass. We have argued that \\( C_2 \\) is a positive quantity, which now implies that \\( m^* \\) is a negative quantity. **An electron moving near the top of an allowed energy band behaves as if it has a negative mass.**\n\nWe must keep in mind that the effective mass parameter is used to relate quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. The attempt to relate these two theories leads to this strange result of a negative effective mass. However, we must recall that solutions to Schrödinger’s wave equation also led to results that contradicted classical mechanics. The negative effective mass is another such example.\n\nIn discussing the concept of effective mass in the previous section, we used an analogy of marbles moving through two liquids. Now consider placing an ice cube in the center of a container filled with water: the ice cube will move upward toward the surface in a direction opposite to the gravitational force. The ice cube appears to have a negative effective mass since its acceleration is opposite to the external force. The effective mass parameter takes into account all internal forces acting on the particle.\n\nIf we again consider an electron near the top of an allowed energy band and use Newton’s force equation for an applied electric field, we will have\n\n\\[\nF = m^* a = -eE\n\\]\n\n(3.57)\n\nHowever, \\( m^* \\) is now a negative quantity, so we may write\n\n\\[\na = -\\frac{eE}{|m^*|} = +\\frac{eE}{|m^*|}\n\\]\n\n(3.58)\n\n**An electron moving near the top of an allowed energy band moves in the same direction as the applied electric field.**\n\nThe net motion of electrons in a nearly full band can be described by considering just the empty states, provided that a positive electronic charge is associated with each state and that the negative of \\( m^* \\) from Equation (3.56) is associated with each state. We now can model this band as having particles with a positive electronic charge and a positive effective mass. The density of these particles in the valence band is the same as the density of empty electronic energy states. This new particle is the hole. The hole, then, has a positive effective mass denoted by \\( m^*_h \\) and a positive electronic charge, so it will move in the same direction as an applied field.\n\n### 3.2.5 Metals, Insulators, and Semiconductors\n\nEach crystal has its own energy-band structure. We noted that the splitting of the energy states in silicon, for example, to form the valence and conduction bands, was complex. Complex band splitting occurs in other crystals, leading to large variations in band structures between various solids and to a wide range of electrical characteristics observed in these various materials. We can qualitatively begin to understand some basic differences in electrical characteristics caused by variations in band structure by considering some simplified energy bands.\n\n\n**Figure 3.19** Allowed energy bands showing (a) an empty band, (b) a completely full band, and (c) the bandgap energy between the two allowed bands.\n\n- **(a)** Allowed energy band (empty)\n- **(b)** Allowed energy band (full)\n- **(c)** Conduction band (empty), Valence band (full), \\( E_g \\)\n\n\n**Figure 3.20** Allowed energy bands showing (a) an almost empty band, (b) an almost full band, and (c) the bandgap energy between the two allowed bands.\n\n- **(a)** Allowed energy band (almost empty)\n- **(b)** Allowed energy band (almost full)\n- **(c)** Conduction band (almost empty), Valence band (almost full), Electrons, Empty electronic states, \\( E_g \\)\n\nThere are several possible energy-band conditions to consider. Figure 3.19a shows an allowed energy band that is completely empty of electrons. If an electric field is applied, there are no particles to move, so there will be no current. Figure 3.19b shows another allowed energy band whose energy states are completely full of electrons. We argued in the previous section that a completely full energy band will also not give rise to a current. A material that has energy bands either completely empty or completely full is an insulator. The resistivity of an insulator is very large or, conversely, the conductivity of an insulator is very small. There are essentially no charged particles that can contribute to a drift current. Figure 3.19c shows a simplified energy-band diagram of an insulator. The bandgap energy \\( E_g \\) of an insulator is usually on the order of 3.5 to 6 eV or larger, so that at room temperature, there are essentially no electrons in the conduction band and the valence band remains completely full. There are very few thermally generated electrons and holes in an insulator.\n\nFigure 3.20a shows an energy band with relatively few electrons near the bottom of the band. Now, if an electric field is applied, the electrons can gain energy, move to higher energy states, and move through the crystal. The net flow of charge is a current. Figure 3.20b shows an allowed energy band that is almost full of electrons, which means that we can consider the holes in this band. If an electric field is applied, the holes can move and give rise to a current. Figure 3.20c shows the simplified energy-band diagram for this case. The bandgap energy may be on the order of 1 eV.\n\n**Figure 3.21**\n\nTwo possible energy bands of a metal showing:\n\n- **(a)** a partially filled band\n- **(b)** overlapping allowed energy bands.\n\n\nThis energy-band diagram represents a semiconductor for \\( T > 0 \\, \\text{K} \\). The resistivity of a semiconductor, as we will see in the next chapter, can be controlled and varied over many orders of magnitude.\n\nThe characteristics of a metal include a very low resistivity. The energy-band diagram for a metal may be in one of two forms. Figure 3.21a shows the case of a partially full band in which there are many electrons available for conduction, so that the material can exhibit a large electrical conductivity. Figure 3.21b shows another possible energy-band diagram of a metal. The band splitting into allowed and forbidden energy bands is a complex phenomenon, and Figure 3.21b shows a case in which the conduction and valence bands overlap at the equilibrium interatomic distance. As in the case shown in Figure 3.21a, there are large numbers of electrons as well as large numbers of empty energy states into which the electrons can move, so this material can also exhibit a very high electrical conductivity.\n\n- **Figure 3.22**: Figure for Exercise TYU 3.3.\n\n\n  \\[\n  E = E_c + 0.32 \\, \\text{eV}\n  \\]\n\n- **Figure 3.23**: Figure for Exercise TYU 3.4.\n\n\n  \\[\n  E = E_v - 0.875 \\, \\text{eV}\n  \\]",

    "text": "## 3.3 Extension to Three Dimensions\n\n### 3.3.1 Extension to Three Dimensions\n\nThe basic concepts of allowed and forbidden energy bands and effective mass have been developed in the previous sections. In this section, we will extend these concepts to three dimensions and to real crystals. We will qualitatively consider particular characteristics of the three-dimensional crystal in terms of the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) plots, bandgap energy, and effective mass. We must emphasize that we will only briefly touch on the basic three-dimensional concepts; therefore, many details will not be considered.\n\nOne problem encountered in extending the potential function to a three-dimensional crystal is that the distance between atoms varies as the direction through the crystal changes. Figure 3.24 shows a face-centered cubic structure with the [100] and [110] directions indicated. Electrons traveling in different directions encounter different potential patterns and therefore different \\( k \\)-space boundaries. The \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagrams are, in general, a function of the \\( k \\)-space direction in a crystal.\n\n#### 3.3.1.1 The \\( k \\)-Space Diagrams of Si and GaAs\n\nFigure 3.25 shows an \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and of silicon (Si). These simplified diagrams show the basic properties considered in this text but do not show many of the details more appropriate for advanced-level courses.\n\nNote that in place of the usual positive and negative \\( k \\) axes, we now show two different crystal directions. The \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram for the one-dimensional model was symmetric in \\( k \\) so that no new information is obtained by displaying the negative axis. It is normal practice to plot the [100] direction along the normal \\( +k \\) axis and to plot the [111] portion of the diagram so the \\( +k \\) points to the left. In the case of diamond or zincblende lattices, the maxima in the valence band energy and minima in the conduction band energy occur at \\( k = 0 \\) or along one of these two directions.\n\nFigure 3.25a shows the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram for GaAs. The valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum both occur at \\( k = 0 \\). The electrons in the\n\n\n**Figure 3.24** | The (100) plane of a face-centered cubic crystal showing the [100] and [110] directions.\n\n**Figure 3.25** Energy-band structures of (a) GaAs and (b) Si.  \n*(From Sze [12].)*\n\nThe conduction band tends to settle at the minimum conduction band energy that is at \\( k = 0 \\). Similarly, holes in the valence band tend to congregate at the uppermost valence band energy. In GaAs, the minimum conduction band energy and maximum valence band energy occur at the same \\( k \\) value. A semiconductor with this property is said to be a **direct bandgap semiconductor**; transitions between the two allowed bands can take place with no change in crystal momentum. This direct nature has a significant effect on the optical properties of the material. GaAs and other direct bandgap materials are ideally suited for use in semiconductor lasers and other optical devices.\n\nThe \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram for silicon is shown in Figure 3.25b. The maximum in the valence band energy occurs at \\( k = 0 \\) as before. The minimum in the conduction band energy occurs not at \\( k = 0 \\), but along the [100] direction. The difference between the minimum conduction band energy and the maximum valence band energy is still defined as the bandgap energy \\( E_g \\). A semiconductor whose maximum valence band energy and minimum conduction band energy do not occur at the same \\( k \\) value is called an **indirect bandgap semiconductor**. When electrons make a transition between the conduction and valence bands, we must invoke the law of conservation of momentum. A transition in an indirect bandgap material must necessarily include an interaction with the crystal so that crystal momentum is conserved.\n\n**Germanium is also an indirect bandgap material**, whose valence band maximum occurs at \\( k = 0 \\) and whose conduction band minimum occurs along the [111] direction. GaAs is a direct bandgap semiconductor, but other compound semiconductors, such as GaP and AlAs, have indirect bandgaps.\n\n### 3.3.2 Additional Effective Mass Concepts\n\nThe curvature of the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagrams near the minimum of the conduction band energy is related to the effective mass of the electron. We may note from Figure 3.25 that the curvature of the conduction band at its minimum value for GaAs is larger than that of silicon, so the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band of GaAs will be smaller than that in silicon.\n\nFor the one-dimensional \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram, the effective mass was defined by Equation (3.41) as \\( 1/m^* = 1/\\hbar^2 \\cdot d^2E/dk^2 \\). A complication occurs in the effective mass concept in a real crystal. A three-dimensional crystal can be described by three \\( k \\) vectors. The curvature of the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) diagram at the conduction band minimum may not be the same in the three \\( k \\) directions. In later sections and chapters, the effective mass parameters used in calculations will be a kind of statistical average that is adequate for most device calculations.²",

    "text": "## 3.4 Density of States Function\n\nAs we have stated, we eventually wish to describe the current–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. Since current is due to the flow of charge, an important step in the process is to determine the number of electrons and holes in the semiconductor that will be available for conduction. The number of carriers that can contribute to the conduction process is a function of the number of available energy or quantum states since, by the Pauli exclusion principle, only one electron can occupy a given quantum state. When we discussed the splitting of energy levels into bands of allowed and forbidden energies, we indicated that the band of allowed energies was actually made up of discrete energy levels. We must determine the density of these allowed energy states as a function of energy in order to calculate the electron and hole concentrations.\n\n### 3.4.1 Mathematical Derivation\n\nTo determine the density of allowed quantum states as a function of energy, we need to consider an appropriate mathematical model. Electrons are allowed to move relatively freely in the conduction band of a semiconductor but are confined to the crystal. As a first step, we will consider a free electron confined to a three-dimensional infinite potential well, where the potential well represents the crystal. The potential of the infinite potential well is defined as\n\n\\[\nV(x, y, z) = \n\\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{for } 0 < x < a \\\\ \n0 & \\text{for } 0 < y < a \\\\ \n0 & \\text{for } 0 < z < a \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV(x, y, z) = \\infty \\quad \\text{elsewhere}\n\\]\n\nwhere the crystal is assumed to be a cube with length \\( a \\). Schrödinger’s wave equation in three dimensions can be solved by using the separation of variables technique.\n\n\n²See Appendix F for further discussion of effective mass concepts.\n\n\n**Figure 3.26** (a) A two-dimensional array of allowed quantum states in \\( k \\) space. (b) The positive one-eighth of the spherical \\( k \\) space.\n\nExtrapolating the results from the one-dimensional infinite potential well, we can show (see Problem 3.23) that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} = k^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2 = \\left( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n(3.60)\n\nwhere \\( n_x, n_y, \\) and \\( n_z \\) are positive integers. (Negative values of \\( n_x, n_y, \\) and \\( n_z \\) yield the same wave function, except for the sign, as the positive integer values, resulting in the same probability function and energy; therefore the negative integers do not represent a different quantum state.)\n\nWe can schematically plot the allowed quantum states in \\( k \\) space. Figure 3.26a shows a two-dimensional plot as a function of \\( k_x \\) and \\( k_z \\). Each point represents an allowed quantum state corresponding to various integral values of \\( n_x \\) and \\( n_z \\). Positive and negative values of \\( k_x, k_y, \\) or \\( k_z \\) have the same energy and represent the same energy state. Since negative values of \\( k_x, k_y, \\) or \\( k_z \\) do not represent additional quantum states, the density of quantum states will be determined by considering only the positive one-eighth of the spherical \\( k \\) space as shown in Figure 3.26b.\n\nThe distance between two quantum states in the \\( k_x \\) direction, for example, is given by\n\n\\[\nk_{x,n+1} - k_{x,n} = (n_x + 1) \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\right) - n_x \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{a}\n\\]\n\n(3.61)\n\nGeneralizing this result to three dimensions, the volume \\( V_k \\) of a single quantum state is\n\n\\[\nV_k = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\right)^3\n\\]\n\n(3.62)\n\nWe can now determine the density of quantum states in \\( k \\) space. A differential volume in \\( k \\) space is shown in Figure 3.26b and is given by \\( 4\\pi k^2 dk \\) so the differential density of quantum states in \\( k \\) space can be written as\n\n\\[\ng_T(k) \\, dk = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{8} \\right) \\frac{4\\pi k^2 \\, dk}{\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\right)^3}\n\\]\n\n(3.63)\n\nThe first factor, 2, takes into account the two spin states allowed for each quantum state; the next factor, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), takes into account that we are considering only the quantum states for positive values of \\(k_x\\), \\(k_y\\), and \\(k_z\\). The factor \\(4\\pi k^2 dk\\) is again the differential volume and the factor \\((\\pi a^3)\\) is the volume of one quantum state. Equation (3.63) may be simplified to\n\n\\[\ng_r(k)dk = \\frac{\\pi k^2 dk}{a^3}\n\\]\n\n(3.64)\n\nEquation (3.64) gives the density of quantum states as a function of momentum, through the parameter \\(k\\). We can now determine the density of quantum states as a function of energy \\(E\\). For a free electron, the parameters \\(E\\) and \\(k\\) are related by\n\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\n\\]\n\n(3.65a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sqrt{2mE}\n\\]\n\n(3.65b)\n\nThe differential \\(dk\\) is\n\n\\[\ndk = \\frac{1}{\\hbar \\sqrt{2E}} \\sqrt{m} \\, dE\n\\]\n\n(3.66)\n\nThen, substituting the expressions for \\(k^2\\) and \\(dk\\) into Equation (3.64), the number of energy states between \\(E\\) and \\(E + dE\\) is given by\n\n\\[\ng_r(E)dE = \\frac{\\pi a^3}{\\pi^3} \\left(\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{2E}} \\, dE\n\\]\n\n(3.67)\n\nSince \\(\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\), Equation (3.67) becomes\n\n\\[\ng_r(E)dE = \\frac{4\\pi a^3}{h^3} \\cdot (2m)^{3/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{E} \\, dE\n\\]\n\n(3.68)\n\nEquation (3.68) gives the total number of quantum states between the energy \\(E\\) and \\(E + dE\\) in the crystal space volume of \\(a^3\\). If we divide by the volume \\(a^3\\), then we will obtain the density of quantum states per unit volume of the crystal. Equation (3.68) then becomes\n\n\\[\ng(E) = \\frac{4\\pi(2m)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E}\n\\]\n\n(3.69)\n\nThe density of quantum states is a function of energy \\(E\\). As the energy of this free electron becomes small, the number of available quantum states decreases. This density function is really a double density, in that the units are given in terms of states per unit energy per unit volume.\n\n### 3.4.2 Extension to Semiconductors\n\nIn the previous section, we derived a general expression for the density of allowed electron quantum states using the model of a free electron with mass \\(m\\) bounded in a three-dimensional infinite potential well. We can extend this same general model to a semiconductor to determine the density of quantum states in the conduction band and the density of quantum states in the valence band. Electrons and holes are confined within the semiconductor crystal, so we will again use the basic model of the infinite potential well.\n\nThe parabolic relationship between energy and momentum of a free electron is given in Equation (3.28) as \\(E = p^2/2m = \\hbar^2k^2/2m\\). Figure 3.16a shows the conduction energy band in the reduced \\(k\\) space. The \\(E\\) versus \\(k\\) curve near \\(k = 0\\) at the bottom of the conduction band can be approximated as a parabola, so we may write:\n\n\\[\nE = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2k^2}{2m^*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(E_c\\) is the bottom edge of the conduction band and \\(m^*\\) is the electron density of states effective mass. Equation (3.70) may be rewritten to give:\n\n\\[\nE = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2k^2}{2m^*}\n\\]\n\n\n*Again, see Appendix F for further discussion of effective mass concepts.*\n\nThe general form of the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) relation for an electron in the bottom of a conduction band is the same as the free electron, except the mass is replaced by the effective mass. We can then think of the electron in the bottom of the conduction band as being a \"free\" electron with its own particular mass. The right side of Equation (3.71) is of the same form as the right side of Equation (3.28), which was used in the derivation of the density of states function. Because of this similarity, which yields the \"free\" conduction electron model, we may generalize the free electron results of Equation (3.69) and write the density of allowed electronic energy states in the conduction band as\n\n\\[\ng_c(E) = \\frac{4\\pi(2m_n)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c}\n\\]\n\n(3.72)\n\nEquation (3.72) is valid for \\( E \\geq E_c \\). As the energy of the electron in the conduction band decreases, the number of available quantum states also decreases.\n\nThe density of quantum states in the valence band can be obtained by using the same infinite potential well model, since the hole is also confined in the semiconductor crystal and can be treated as a \"free\" particle. The density of states effective mass of the hole is \\( m_p^* \\). Figure 3.16b shows the valence energy band in the reduced \\( k \\) space. We may also approximate the \\( E \\) versus \\( k \\) curve near \\( k = 0 \\) by a parabola for a \"free\" hole, so that\n\n\\[\nE = E_v - \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_p^*}\n\\]\n\n(3.73)\n\nEquation (3.73) may be rewritten to give\n\n\\[\nE_v - E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_p^*}\n\\]\n\n(3.74)\n\nAgain, the right side of Equation (3.74) is of the same form used in the general derivation of the density of states function. We may then generalize the density of states function from Equation (3.69) to apply to the valence band, so that\n\n\\[\ng_v(E) = \\frac{4\\pi(2m_p^*)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E_v - E}\n\\]\n\n(3.75)\n\nEquation (3.75) is valid for \\( E \\leq E_v \\).\n\nWe have argued that quantum states do not exist within the forbidden energy band, so \\( g(E) = 0 \\) for \\( E_c < E < E_v \\). Figure 3.27 shows the plot of the density of quantum states as a function of energy. If the electron and hole effective masses were equal, then the functions \\( g_c(E) \\) and \\( g_v(E) \\) would be symmetrical about the energy midway between \\( E_c \\) and \\( E_v \\), or the midgap energy, \\( E_{\\text{midgap}} \\).\n\n\n**Figure 3.27** The density of energy states in the conduction band and the density of energy states in the valence band as a function of energy.",

    "text": "## 3.5 Statistical Mechanics\nIn dealing with large numbers of particles, we are interested only in the statistical behavior of the group as a whole rather than in the behavior of each individual particle. For example, gas within a container will exert an average pressure on the walls of the vessel. The pressure is actually due to the collisions of the individual gas molecules with the walls, but we do not follow each individual molecule as it collides with the wall. Likewise in a crystal, the electrical  characteristics will  be determined by the statistical behavior of a large number of electrons. \n\n### 3.5.1  Statistical Laws \nIn determining the statistical behavior of particles, we must consider the laws that the particles obey. There are three distribution laws determining the distribution of particles among available energy states. \n\nOne distribution law is the Maxwell–Boltzmann probability function. In this case, the particles are considered to be distinguishable by being numbered, for example, from 1 to N, with no limit to the number of particles allowed in each energy state. The behavior of gas molecules in a container at fairly low pressure is an example of this distribution. \nA second distribution law is the Bose–Einstein function. The particles in this case are indistinguishable and, again, there is no limit to the number of particles permitted in each quantum state. The behavior of photons, or black body radiation, is an example of this law. \nThe third distribution law is the Fermi–Dirac probability function. In this case, the particles are again indistinguishable, but now only one particle is permitted in each quantum state. Electrons in a crystal obey this law. In each case, the particles are assumed to be noninteracting. \n\n### 3.5.2 The Fermi-Dirac Probability Function\n\nFigure 3.28 shows the $i$th energy level with $g_i$ quantum states. A maximum of one particle is allowed in each quantum state by the Pauli exclusion principle. There are $g_i$ ways of choosing where to place the first particle, $(g_i - 1)$ ways of choosing where to place the second particle, $(g_i - 2)$ ways of choosing where to place the third particle, and so on. Then the total number of ways of arranging $N_i$ particles in the $i$th energy level (where $N_i \\leq g_i$) is\n\n\\[\n(g_i)(g_i - 1) \\cdots (g_i - (N_i - 1)) = \\frac{g_i!}{(g_i - N_i)!}\n\\]\n(3.76)\n\nThis expression includes all permutations of the $N_i$ particles among themselves.\n\n**Figure 3.28** | The $i$th energy level with $g_i$ quantum states. \n\nHowever, since the particles are indistinguishable, the \\(N_i!\\) number of permutations that the particles have among themselves in any given arrangement do not count as separate arrangements. The interchange of any two electrons, for example, does not produce a new arrangement. Therefore, the actual number of independent ways of realizing a distribution of \\(N_i\\) particles in the \\(i\\)th level is\n\n\\[\nW_i = \\frac{g_i!}{N_i!(g_i - N_i)!}\n\\]\n\n(3.77)\n\nEquation (3.77) gives the number of independent ways of realizing a distribution of \\(N_i\\) particles in the \\(i\\)th level. The total number of ways of arranging \\((N_1, N_2, N_3, \\ldots, N_n)\\) indistinguishable particles among \\(n\\) energy levels is the product of all distributions, or\n\n\\[\nW = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{g_i!}{N_i!(g_i - N_i)!}\n\\]\n\n(3.78)\n\nThe parameter \\(W\\) is the total number of ways in which \\(N\\) electrons can be arranged in this system, where \\(N = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i\\) is the total number of electrons in the system. We want to find the most probable distribution, which means that we want to find the maximum \\(W\\). The maximum \\(W\\) is found by varying \\(N_i\\) among the \\(E_i\\) levels, which varies the distribution, but at the same time, we will keep the total number of particles and total energy constant.\n\nWe may write the most probable distribution function as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N(E)}{g(E)} = f_F(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E - E_F}{kT}\\right)}\n\\]\n\n(3.79)\n\nThe number density \\( N(E) \\) is the number of particles per unit volume per unit energy and the function \\( g(E) \\) is the number of quantum states per unit volume per unit energy. The function \\( f(E) \\) is called the **Fermi–Dirac distribution** or probability function and gives the probability that a quantum state at the energy \\( E \\) will be occupied by an electron. The energy \\( E_F \\) is called the **Fermi energy**. Another interpretation of the distribution function is that \\( f(E) \\) is the ratio of filled to total quantum states at any energy \\( E \\).\n\n### 3.5.3 The Distribution Function and the Fermi Energy\n\nTo begin to understand the meaning of the distribution function and the Fermi energy, we can plot the distribution function versus energy. Initially, let \\( T = 0 \\) K and consider the case when \\( E < E_F \\). The exponential term in Equation (3.79) becomes \\(\\exp[(E - E_F)/kT] = \\exp(-\\infty) = 0\\). The resulting distribution function is \\( f(E < E_F) = 1 \\).\n\nAgain let \\( T = 0 \\) K and consider the case when \\( E > E_F \\). The exponential term in the distribution function becomes \\(\\exp[(E - E_F)/kT] = \\exp(+\\infty) = +\\infty\\). The resulting Fermi–Dirac distribution function now becomes \\( f(E > E_F) = 0 \\).\n\nThe Fermi–Dirac distribution function for \\( T = 0 \\) K is plotted in Figure 3.29. This result shows that, for \\( T = 0 \\) K, the electrons are in their lowest possible energy states. The probability of a quantum state being occupied is unity for \\( E < E_F \\) and the probability of a state being occupied is zero for \\( E > E_F \\). All electrons have energies below the Fermi energy at \\( T = 0 \\) K.\n\nFigure 3.30 shows discrete energy levels of a particular system as well as the number of available quantum states at each energy. If we assume, for this case, that the system contains 13 electrons, then Figure 3.30 shows how these electrons are distributed among the various quantum states at \\( T = 0 \\) K. The electrons will be in the lowest possible energy state, so the probability of a quantum state being occupied in energy levels \\( E_1 \\) through \\( E_3 \\) is unity, and the probability of a quantum state being occupied in energy level \\( E_4 \\) is zero. The Fermi energy, for this case, must be above \\( E_4 \\) but less than \\( E_5 \\). The Fermi energy determines the statistical distribution of electrons and does not have to correspond to an allowed energy level.\n\nNow consider a case in which the density of quantum states \\( g(E) \\) is a continuous function of energy, as shown in Figure 3.31. If we have \\( N_0 \\) electrons in this system,\n\n**Figure 3.29** The Fermi probability function versus energy for \\( T = 0 \\) K.\n\n**Figure 3.30** Discrete energy states and quantum states for a particular system at \\( T = 0 \\) K.\n\n**Figure 3.31** Density of quantum states and electrons in a continuous energy system at \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n\n\\[\nN_s = \\int_{0}^{E_F} g(E) \\, dE\n\\]\n\n\n**Figure 3.32** Discrete energy states and quantum states for the same system shown in Figure 3.30 for \\( T > 0 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n\n\nWhen the distribution of these electrons among the quantum states at \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\) is shown by the dashed line, the electrons are in the lowest possible energy state so that all states below \\( E_F \\) are filled and all states above \\( E_F \\) are empty. If \\( g(E) \\) and \\( N_s \\) are known for this particular system, then the Fermi energy \\( E_F \\) can be determined.\n\nConsider the situation when the temperature increases above \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\). Electrons gain a certain amount of thermal energy so that some electrons can jump to higher energy levels, which means that the distribution of electrons among the available energy states will change. Figure 3.32 shows the same discrete energy levels and quantum states as in Figure 3.30. The distribution of electrons among the quantum states has changed from the \\( T = 0 \\, \\text{K} \\) case. Two electrons from the \\( E_4 \\) level have gained enough energy to jump to \\( E_5 \\), and one electron from \\( E_2 \\) has jumped to \\( E_4 \\). As the temperature changes, the distribution of electrons versus energy changes.\n\nThe change in the electron distribution among energy levels for \\( T > 0 \\, \\text{K} \\) can be seen by plotting the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. If we let \\( E = E_F \\) and \\( T > 0 \\, \\text{K} \\), then Equation (3.79) becomes\n\n\\[\nf_k(E = E_F) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(0)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe probability of a state being occupied at \\( E = E_F \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Figure 3.33 shows the Fermi–Dirac distribution function plotted for several temperatures, assuming that the Fermi energy is independent of temperature.\n\n**Figure 3.33** The Fermi probability function versus energy for different temperatures.\n\nWe can see from Figure 3.33 that the probability of an energy above \\( E_F \\) being occupied increases as the temperature increases and the probability of a state below \\( E_F \\) being empty increases as the temperature increases.\n\nWe may note that the probability of a state a distance \\(dE\\) above \\(E_F\\) being occupied is the same as the probability of a state a distance \\(dE\\) below \\(E_F\\) being empty. The function \\(f_F(E)\\) is symmetrical with the function \\(1 - f_F(E)\\) about the Fermi energy, \\(E_F\\). This symmetry effect is shown in Figure 3.34 and will be used in the next chapter.\n\nConsider the case when \\(E - E_F \\gg kT\\) where the exponential term in the denominator of Equation (3.79) is much greater than unity. We may neglect the 1 in the denominator, so the Fermi–Dirac distribution function becomes\n\n\\[\nf_F(E) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E - E_F}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(3.80)\n\nEquation (3.80) is known as the Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation, or simply the Boltzmann approximation, to the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. Figure 3.35 shows the Fermi–Dirac probability function and the Boltzmann approximation. This figure gives an indication of the range of energies over which the approximation is valid.\n\n\n**Figure 3.34** The probability of a state being occupied, \\(f_F(E)\\), and the probability of a state being empty, \\(1 - f_F(E)\\).\n\n\n**Figure 3.35** | The Fermi–Dirac probability function and the Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation.\n\nThe actual Boltzmann approximation is valid when \\(\\exp[(E - E_F)/kT] \\gg 1\\). However, it is still common practice to use the \\(E - E_F \\gg kT\\) notation when applying the Boltzmann approximation. We will use this Boltzmann approximation in our discussion of semiconductors in the next chapter.",

    "text": "## 12.1 | THE BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR ACTION\n\nThe bipolar transistor has three separately doped regions and two pn junctions. Figure 12.1 shows the basic structure of an npn bipolar transistor and a pnp bipolar transistor, along with the circuit symbols. The three terminal connections are called the emitter, base, and collector. The width of the base region is small compared to the minority carrier diffusion length. The (+++) and (++) notation indicates the relative magnitudes of the impurity doping concentrations normally used in the bipolar transistor, with (+++) meaning very heavily doped and (++) meaning moderately doped. The emitter region has the largest doping concentration; the collector region has the smallest. The reasons for using these relative impurity concentrations, and for the narrow base width, will become clear as we develop the theory of the bipolar transistor. The concepts developed for the pn junction apply directly to the bipolar transistor.\n\nThe block diagrams of Figure 12.1 show the basic structure of the transistor, but in very simplified sketches. Figure 12.2a shows a cross section of a classic npn bipolar transistor fabricated in an integrated circuit configuration, and Figure 12.2b shows the cross section of an npn bipolar transistor fabricated by a more modern technology. One can immediately observe that the actual structure of the bipolar transistor is not nearly as simple as the block diagrams of Figure 12.1 might suggest. A reason for the complexity is that terminal connections are made at the surface; in order to minimize semiconductor resistances, heavily doped n+ buried layers must be included. Another reason for complexity arises out of the desire to fabricate more than one bipolar transistor on a single piece of semiconductor material. Individual transistors must be isolated from each other since all collectors, for example, will not be at the same potential. This isolation is accomplished by adding p+ regions so that devices are separated by reverse-biased pn junctions as shown in Figure 12.2a, or they are isolated by large oxide regions as shown in Figure 12.2b.\n\n**Figure 12.1** | Simplified block diagrams and circuit symbols of (a) npn and (b) pnp bipolar transistors.\n\n**Figure 12.2** | Cross section of (a) a conventional integrated circuit npn bipolar transistor and (b) an oxide-isolated npn bipolar transistor.  \n*(From Muller and Kamins [4].)*\n\nAn important point to note from the devices shown in Figure 12.2 is that the bipolar transistor is not a symmetrical device. Although the transistor may contain two n regions or two p regions, the impurity doping concentrations in the emitter and collector are different and the geometry of these regions can be vastly different. The block diagrams of Figure 12.1 are highly simplified, but useful, concepts in the development of the basic transistor theory.\n\n### 12.1.1 The Basic Principle of Operation\n\nThe npn and pnp transistors are complementary devices. We develop the bipolar transistor theory using the npn transistor, but the same basic principles and equations also apply to the pnp device. Figure 12.3 shows an idealized impurity doping profile in an npn bipolar transistor for the case when each region is uniformly doped. Typical impurity doping concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector may be on the order of \\(10^{19}\\), \\(10^{17}\\), and \\(10^{15}\\) cm\\(^{-3}\\), respectively.\n\nThe base–emitter (B–E) pn junction is forward biased and the base–collector (B–C) pn junction is reverse biased in the normal bias configuration as shown in Figure 12.3.\n\n\n**Figure 12.3** | Idealized doping profile of a uniformly doped npn bipolar transistor.\n\n\n**Figure 12.4** (a) Biasing of an npn bipolar transistor in the forward-active mode, (b) minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active mode, and (c) energy-band diagram of the npn bipolar transistor under zero bias and under a forward-active mode bias.\n\nFigure 12.4a. This configuration is called the **forward-active** operating mode: The B–E junction is forward biased so electrons from the emitter are injected across the B–E junction into the base. These injected electrons create an excess concentration of minority carriers in the base. The B–C junction is reverse biased, so the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the B–C junction is ideally zero. We expect the electron concentration in the base to be like that shown in\n\n**Diagrams**\n\n- **(a)** Circuit diagram showing biasing of an npn bipolar transistor.\n- **(b)** Graph showing minority carrier distribution in the transistor.\n- **(c)** Energy-band diagram of the npn bipolar transistor.\n\n**Key Components**\n\n- **E**: Emitter\n- **B**: Base\n- **C**: Collector\n- **\\(i_E\\)**: Emitter current\n- **\\(i_C\\)**: Collector current\n- **\\(R_E\\)**: Emitter resistance\n- **\\(R_C\\)**: Collector resistance\n- **\\(V_{BE}\\)**: Base-emitter voltage\n- **\\(V_{CB}\\)**: Collector-base voltage\n- **\\(V_{BB}\\)**: Base bias voltage\n- **\\(V_{CC}\\)**: Collector bias voltage\n\n**Graphs**\n\n- **E–B space charge region**: Shows electric field and carrier concentration.\n- **B–C space charge region**: Shows electric field and carrier concentration.\n\n**Energy-Band Diagram**\n\n- **Zero bias**: Shows energy levels without applied voltage.\n- **Forward active**: Shows energy levels with forward-active bias.\n\n**Equations**\n\n- **Carrier Concentration**: \\( P_{n0}(x) \\), \\( P_{p0}(x) \\)\n- **Energy Levels**: \\( E_C \\), \\( E_F \\), \\( E_V \\)\n\n**Figure 12.5** | Cross section of an npn bipolar transistor showing the injection and collection of electrons in the forward-active mode.\n\nFigure 12.4b. The large gradient in the electron concentration means that electrons injected from the emitter will diffuse across the base region into the B–C space charge region, where the electric field will sweep the electrons into the collector. We want as many electrons as possible to reach the collector without recombining with any majority carrier holes in the base. For this reason, the width of the base needs to be small compared with the minority carrier diffusion length. If the base width is small, then the minority carrier electron concentration is a function of both the B–E and B–C junction voltages. The two junctions are close enough to be called interacting pn junctions.\n\nFigure 12.5 shows a cross section of an npn transistor with the injection of electrons from the n-type emitter (hence the name emitter) and the collection of the electrons in the collector (hence the name collector).\n\n### 12.1.2 Simplified Transistor Current Relation—Qualitative Discussion\n\nWe can gain a basic understanding of the operation of the transistor and the relations between the various currents and voltages by considering a simplified analysis. After this discussion, we delve into a more detailed analysis of the physics of the bipolar transistor.\n\nThe minority carrier concentrations are again shown in Figure 12.6 for an npn bipolar transistor biased in the forward-active mode. Ideally, the minority carrier electron concentration in the base is a linear function of distance, which implies no recombination. The electrons diffuse across the base and are swept into the collector by the electric field in the B–C space charge region.\n\n#### Collector Current\n\nAssuming the ideal linear electron distribution in the base, the collector current can be written as a diffusion current given by\n\n\\[\ni_C = eD_nA_{BE} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} \\bigg|_{x=0} = eD_nA_{BE} \\left[ \\frac{n_{b0}(0) - 0}{0 - x_B} \\right] = -\\frac{eD_nA_{BE}}{x_B} \\cdot n_{b0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_t}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.1)\n\nwhere \\( A_{BE} \\) is the cross-sectional area of the B–E junction, \\( n_{b0} \\) is the thermal-equilibrium electron concentration in the base, and \\( V_t \\) is the thermal voltage. The\n\n**Figure 12.6** | Minority carrier distributions and basic currents in a forward-biased npn bipolar transistor.\n\nThe diffusion of electrons is in the \\(+x\\) direction so that the conventional current is in the \\(-x\\) direction. Considering magnitudes only, Equation (12.1) can be written as\n\n\\[\ni_c = I_S \\exp \\left( \\frac{v_{BE}}{V_T} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.2)\n\nThe collector current is controlled by the base–emitter voltage; that is, the current at one terminal of the device is controlled by the voltage applied to the other two terminals of the device. As we have mentioned, this is the basic transistor action.\n\n#### Emitter Current\n\nOne component of emitter current, \\(i_{E1}\\), shown in Figure 12.6 is due to the flow of electrons injected from the emitter into the base. This current, then, is equal to the collector current given by Equation (12.1).\n\nSince the base–emitter junction is forward biased, majority carrier holes in the base are injected across the B–E junction into the emitter. These injected holes produce a pn junction current \\(i_{E2}\\) as indicated in Figure 12.6. This current is only a B–E junction current so this component of emitter current is not part of the collector current. Since \\(i_{E2}\\) is a forward-biased pn junction current, we can write (considering magnitude only)\n\n\\[\ni_{E2} = I_{S2} \\exp \\left( \\frac{v_{BE}}{V_T} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.3)\n\n**Figure 12.7** Ideal bipolar transistor common-base current–voltage characteristics.\n\nwhere \\( i_{E2} \\) involves the minority carrier hole parameters in the emitter. The total emitter current is the sum of the two components, or\n\n\\[\ni_E = i_{E1} + i_{E2} = i_C + i_{E2} = I_{SE} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_t} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.4)\n\nSince all current components in Equation (12.4) are functions of \\(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_t)\\), the ratio of collector current to emitter current is a constant. We can write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{i_C}{i_E} = \\alpha\n\\]\n\n(12.5)\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is called the **common-base current gain**. By considering Equation (12.4), we see that \\(i_C < i_E\\) or \\(\\alpha < 1\\). Since \\(i_{E2}\\) is not part of the basic transistor action, we would like this component of current to be as small as possible. We would then like the common-base current gain to be as close to unity as possible.\n\nReferring to Figure 12.4a and Equation (12.4), note that the emitter current is an exponential function of the base–emitter voltage and the collector current is \\(i_C = \\alpha i_E\\). To a first approximation, the collector current is independent of the base–collector voltage as long as the B–C junction is reverse biased. We can sketch the common-base transistor characteristics as shown in Figure 12.7. The bipolar transistor acts like a constant current source.\n\n#### Base Current\n\nAs shown in Figure 12.6, the component of emitter current \\(i_{E2}\\) is a B–E junction current so that this current is also a component of base current shown as \\(i_{B1}\\). This component of base current is proportional to \\(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_t)\\).\n\nThere is also a second component of base current. We have considered the ideal case in which there is no recombination of minority carrier electrons with majority carrier holes in the base. However, in reality, there will be some recombination. Since majority carrier holes in the base are disappearing, they must be resupplied by a flow of positive charge into the base terminal. This flow of charge is indicated as a current \\(i_{B2}\\) in Figure 12.6. The number of holes per unit time recombining in the base is directly related to the number of minority carrier electrons in the base.\n\n\n[see Equation (6.13)]. Therefore, the current \\(i_{BE}\\) is also proportional to \\(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)\\). The total base current is the sum of \\(i_{BE}\\) and \\(i_{BC}\\) and is proportional to \\(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)\\).\n\nThe ratio of collector current to base current is a constant since both currents are directly proportional to \\(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)\\). We can then write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{i_C}{i_B} = \\beta\n\\]\n\n(12.6)\n\nwhere \\(\\beta\\) is called the **common-emitter current gain**. Normally, the base current will be relatively small so that, in general, the common-emitter current gain is much larger than unity (on the order of 100 or larger).\n\n### 12.1.3 The Modes of Operation\n\nFigure 12.8 shows the npn transistor in a simple circuit. In this configuration, the transistor may be biased in one of three modes of operation. If the B–E voltage is zero or reverse biased (\\(V_{BE} \\leq 0\\)), then majority carrier electrons from the emitter will not be injected into the base. The B–C junction is also reverse biased; thus, the emitter and collector currents will be zero for this case. This condition is referred to as **cutoff**—all currents in the transistor are zero.\n\nWhen the B–E junction becomes forward biased, an emitter current will be generated as we have discussed, and the injection of electrons into the base results in a collector current. We may write the KVL equations around the collector–emitter loop as\n\n\\[\nV_{CC} = I_C R_C + V_{CB} + V_{BE} = V_R + V_{CE}\n\\]\n\n(12.7)\n\nIf \\(V_{CC}\\) is large enough and if \\(V_R\\) is small enough, then \\(V_{CB} > 0\\), which means that the B–C junction is reverse biased for this npn transistor. Again, this condition is the forward-active region of operation.\n\nAs the forward-biased B–E voltage increases, the collector current and hence \\(V_R\\) will also increase. The increase in \\(V_R\\) means that the reverse-biased C–B voltage decreases, or \\(|V_{CB}|\\) decreases. At some point, the collector current may become large.\n\n\n**Figure 12.8** | An npn bipolar transistor in a common-emitter circuit configuration.\n\n**Figure 12.9** | Bipolar transistor common-emitter current–voltage characteristics with load line superimposed.\n\nenough that the combination of \\(V_R\\) and \\(V_{CC}\\) produces 0 V across the B–C junction. A slight increase in \\(I_C\\) beyond this point will cause a slight increase in \\(V_R\\) and the B–C junction will become forward biased (\\(V_{CB} < 0\\)). This condition is called **saturation**. In the saturation mode of operation, both B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased and the collector current is no longer controlled by the B–E voltage.\n\nFigure 12.9 shows the transistor current characteristics, \\(I_C\\) versus \\(V_{CE}\\), for constant base currents when the transistor is connected in the common-emitter configuration (Figure 12.8). When the collector–emitter voltage is large enough so that the base–collector junction is reverse biased, the collector current is a constant in this first-order theory. For small values of C–E voltage, the base–collector junction becomes forward biased and the collector current decreases to zero for a constant base current.\n\nWriting a Kirchhoff’s voltage equation around the C–E loop, we find\n\n\\[\nV_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_C R_C\n\\]\n\n(12.8)\n\nEquation (12.8) shows a linear relation between collector current and collector–emitter voltage. This linear relation is called a **load line** and is plotted in Figure 12.9. The load line, superimposed on the transistor characteristics, can be used to visualize the bias condition and operating mode of the transistor. The cutoff mode occurs when \\(I_C = 0\\), saturation occurs when there is no longer a change in collector current for a change in base current, and the forward-active mode occurs when the relation \\(I_C = \\beta I_B\\) is valid. These three operating modes are indicated on the figure.\n\nA fourth mode of operation for the bipolar transistor is possible, although not with the circuit configuration shown in Figure 12.8. This fourth mode, known as\n\n\n*The concept of “saturation” for the bipolar transistor is not the same as the principle of the “saturation region” for the MOSFET described in Chapter 10. The term “saturation” as applied to the BJT means that the output current and output voltage do not change as the base–emitter voltage changes. The term “saturation region” as applied to the MOSFET means that the output current does not change (ideally) with a change in the drain-to-source voltage.*\n\n\n**inverse active**, occurs when the B–E junction is reverse biased and the B–C junction is forward biased. In this case, the transistor is operating “upside down,” and the roles of the emitter and collector are reversed. We have argued that the transistor is not a symmetrical device; therefore, the inverse-active characteristics will not be the same as the forward-active characteristics.\n\nThe junction voltage conditions for the four operating modes are shown in Figure 12.10.\n\n### 12.1.4 Amplification with Bipolar Transistors\n\nVoltages and currents can be amplified by bipolar transistors in conjunction with other elements. We demonstrate this amplification qualitatively in the following discussion. Figure 12.11 shows an npn bipolar transistor in a common-emitter configuration. The dc voltage sources, \\( V_{BB} \\) and \\( V_{CC} \\), are used to bias the transistor in the forward-active mode. The voltage source \\( v_i \\) represents a time-varying input voltage (such as a signal from a satellite) that needs to be amplified.\n\nFigure 12.12 shows the various voltages and currents that are generated in the circuit assuming that \\( v_i \\) is a sinusoidal voltage. The sinusoidal voltage \\( v_i \\) induces a sinusoidal component of base current superimposed on a dc quiescent value. Since \\( i_C = \\beta i_B \\), then a relatively large sinusoidal collector current is superimposed on a dc value of collector current. The time-varying collector current induces a time-varying voltage across the \\( R_C \\) resistor which, by Kirchhoff’s voltage law, means that a sinusoidal voltage, superimposed on a dc value, exists between the collector and emitter of the bipolar transistor. The sinusoidal voltages in the collector–emitter portion of the circuit are larger than the signal input voltage \\( v_i \\), so that the circuit has produced a **voltage gain** in the time-varying signals. Hence, the circuit is known as a **voltage amplifier**.\n\n**Figure 12.10** | Junction voltage conditions for the four operating modes of a bipolar transistor.\n\n|            | \\( V_{CE} \\) |            |\n|------------|--------------|------------|\n| Cutoff     | Forward      |            |\n|            | active       |            |\n| Inverse    | Saturation   |            |\n| active     |              |            |\n|            | \\( V_{BE} \\) |            |\n\n**Figure 12.11** | Common-emitter npn bipolar circuit configuration with a time-varying signal voltage \\( v_i \\) included in the base–emitter loop.\n\n- Circuit diagram showing:\n  - \\( R_B \\)\n  - \\( i_B \\)\n  - \\( v_i \\)\n  - \\( V_{BB} \\)\n  - \\( i_C \\)\n  - \\( v_R \\)\n  - \\( R_C \\)\n  - \\( v_{CE} \\)\n  - \\( V_{CC} \\)",

Since diffusion currents are produced by minority carrier gradients, we must determine the steady-state minority carrier distribution in each of the three transistor regions. Let us first consider the forward-active mode, and then the other modes of operation. Table 12.1 summarizes the notation used in the following analysis.\n\n**Table 12.1** Notation used in the analysis of the bipolar transistor\n\n| Notation | Definition |\n|----------|------------|\n| **For both the npn and pnp transistors** | |\n| \\( N_E, N_B, N_C \\) | Doping concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector |\n| \\( x_E, x_B, x_C \\) | Widths of neutral emitter, base, and collector regions |\n| \\( D_E, D_B, D_C \\) | Minority carrier diffusion coefficients in emitter, base, and collector regions |\n| \\( L_E, L_B, L_C \\) | Minority carrier diffusion lengths in emitter, base, and collector regions |\n| \\( \\tau_E, \\tau_B, \\tau_C \\) | Minority carrier lifetimes in emitter, base, and collector regions |\n| **For the npn** | |\n| \\( p_{n0}, n_{b0}, p_{c0} \\) | Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier hole, electron, and hole concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector |\n| \\( p(x'), n(x), p(x'') \\) | Total minority carrier hole, electron, and hole concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector |\n| \\( \\delta p(x'), \\delta n(x), \\delta p(x'') \\) | Excess minority carrier hole, electron, and hole concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector |\n| **For the pnp** | |\n| \\( n_{n0}, p_{b0}, n_{c0} \\) | Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron, hole, and electron concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector |\n| \\( n(x'), p(x), n(x'') \\) | Total minority carrier electron, hole, and electron concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector |\n| \\( \\delta n(x'), \\delta p(x), \\delta n(x'') \\) | Excess minority carrier electron, hole, and electron concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector |\n\n\n**Figure 12.13** Geometry of the npn bipolar transistor used to calculate the minority carrier distribution.\n\n### 12.2.1 Forward-Active Mode\n\nConsider a uniformly doped npn bipolar transistor with the geometry shown in Figure 12.13. When we consider the individual emitter, base, and collector regions, we shift the origin to the edge of the space charge region and consider a positive \\( x, x', \\) or \\( x'' \\) coordinate as shown in the figure.\n\nIn the forward-active mode, the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C is reverse biased. We expect the minority carrier distributions to look like those shown.\n\n**Figure 12.14** Minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active mode.\n\nIn Figure 12.14, as there are two n regions, we have minority carrier holes in both emitter and collector. To distinguish between these two minority carrier hole distributions, we use the notation shown in the figure. Keep in mind that we are dealing only with minority carriers. The parameters \\( p_{E0}, n_{B0}, \\) and \\( p_{C0} \\) denote the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector, respectively. The functions \\( p_E(x'), n_B(x), \\) and \\( p_C(x'') \\) denote the steady-state minority carrier concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector, respectively. We assume that the neutral collector length \\( x_C \\) is long compared to the minority carrier diffusion length \\( L_C \\) in the collector, but we take into account a finite emitter length \\( x_E \\). If we assume that the surface recombination velocity at \\( x' = x_E \\) is infinite, then the excess minority carrier concentration at \\( x' = x_E \\) is zero, or \\( p_E(x' = x_E) = p_{E0} \\). An infinite surface recombination velocity is a good approximation when an ohmic contact is fabricated at \\( x' = x_E \\).\n\n#### Base Region\n\nThe steady-state excess minority carrier electron concentration is found from the ambipolar transport equation, which we discussed in detail in Chapter 6. For a zero electric field in the neutral base region, the ambipolar transport equation in steady state reduces to\n\n\\[\nD_B \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta n_B(x))}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_B(x)}{\\tau_{B0}} = 0\n\\]\n\n(12.9)\n\nwhere \\( \\delta n_B \\) is the excess minority carrier electron concentration, and \\( D_B \\) and \\( \\tau_{B0} \\) are the minority carrier diffusion coefficient and lifetime in the base region, respectively. The excess electron concentration is defined as\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_B(x) = n_B(x) - n_{B0}\n\\]\n\n(12.10)\n\nThe general solution to Equation (12.9) can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_B(x) = A \\exp \\left( \\frac{x}{L_B} \\right) + B \\exp \\left( \\frac{-x}{L_B} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.11)\n\n\nwhere \\( L_B \\) is the minority carrier diffusion length in the base, given by \\( L_B = \\sqrt{D_B \\tau_{B0}} \\). The base is of finite width so both exponential terms in Equation (12.11) must be retained.\n\nThe excess minority carrier electron concentrations at the two boundaries become\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{B}(x = 0) = \\delta n_{B}(0) = A + B\n\\]\n\n(12.12a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{B}(x = x_B) = \\delta n_{B}(x_B) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{+x_B}{L_B}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(\\frac{-x_B}{L_B}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.12b)\n\nThe B–E junction is forward biased, so the boundary condition at \\( x = 0 \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{B}(0) = n_{B}(x = 0) - n_{B0} = n_{B0} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT}\\right) - 1\\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.13a)\n\nThe B–C junction is reverse biased, so the second boundary condition at \\( x = x_B \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{B}(x_B) = n_{B}(x = x_B) - n_{B0} = 0 - n_{B0} = -n_{B0}\n\\]\n\n(12.13b)\n\nFrom the boundary conditions given by Equations (12.13a) and (12.13b), the coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) from Equations (12.12a) and (12.12b) can be determined. The results are\n\n\\[\nA = -n_{B0} - n_{B0} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT}\\right) - 1\\right] \\exp\\left(\\frac{-x_B}{L_B}\\right) \\bigg/ 2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x_B}{L_B}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.14a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nB = n_{B0} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT}\\right) - 1\\right] \\exp\\left(\\frac{x_B}{L_B}\\right) + n_{B0} \\bigg/ 2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x_B}{L_B}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.14b)\n\nThen, substituting Equations (12.14a) and (12.14b) into Equation (12.9), we can write the excess minority carrier electron concentration in the base region as\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{B}(x) = \\frac{n_{B0} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT}\\right) - 1\\right] \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x_B - x}{L_B}\\right) - \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_B}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{x_B}{L_B}\\right)}\n\\]\n\n(12.15a)\n\nEquation (12.15a) may look formidable with the sinh functions. We have stressed that we want the base width \\( x_B \\) to be small compared to the minority carrier diffusion length \\( L_B \\). This condition may seem somewhat arbitrary at this point, but the reason becomes clear as we proceed through all of the calculations. Since we want \\( x_B < L_B \\), the argument in the sinh functions is always less than unity and in most cases will be much less than unity. Figure 12.15 shows a plot of sinh \\( y \\) for \\( 0 \\leq y \\leq 1 \\) and also shows the linear approximation for small values of \\( y \\). If \\( y < 0.4 \\), the sinh \\( y \\) function differs from its linear approximation by less than 3 percent. All of this leads to the conclusion that the excess electron concentration \\( \\delta n_{B} \\) in Equation (12.15a) is approximately a linear function of \\( x \\) through the neutral base region.\n\n**Figure 12.15** Hyperbolic sine function and its linear approximation.\n\nUsing the approximation that \\(\\sinh(x) \\approx x\\) for \\(x \\ll 1\\), the excess electron concentration in the base is given by\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_{b}(x) \\approx \\frac{n_{b0}}{x_{b}} \\left[ \\left( \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right) (x_{B} - x) - x \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.15b)\n\nWe use this linear approximation later in some of the example calculations. The difference in the excess carrier concentrations determined from Equations (12.15a) and (12.15b) is demonstrated in the following exercise.\n\nTable 12.2 shows the Taylor expansions of some of the hyperbolic functions that are encountered in this section of the chapter. In most cases, we consider only the linear terms when expanding these functions.\n\n**Table 12.2**| Taylor expansions of hyperbolic functions\n\n| Function | Taylor expansion |\n|----------|------------------|\n| sinh \\(x\\) | \\(x + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} + \\cdots\\) |\n| cosh \\(x\\) | \\(1 + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\cdots\\) |\n| tanh \\(x\\) | \\(x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{2x^5}{15} + \\cdots\\) |\n\n#### Emitter Region\n\nConsider, now, the minority carrier hole concentration in the emitter. The steady-state excess hole concentration is determined from the equation\n\n\\[\nD_E \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta p_E(x'))}{\\partial x'^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_E(x')}{\\tau_{E0}} = 0\n\\]\n\n(12.16)\n\nwhere \\(D_E\\) and \\(\\tau_{E0}\\) are the minority carrier diffusion coefficient and minority carrier lifetime, respectively, in the emitter. The excess hole concentration is given by\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_E(x') = p_E(x') - p_{E0}\n\\]\n\n(12.17)\n\nThe general solution to Equation (12.16) can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_E(x') = C \\exp \\left( \\frac{x'}{L_E} \\right) + D \\exp \\left( -\\frac{x'}{L_E} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.18)\n\nwhere \\(L_E = \\sqrt{D_E \\tau_{E0}}\\). If we assume the neutral emitter length \\(x_E\\) is not necessarily long compared to \\(L_E\\), then both exponential terms in Equation (12.18) must be retained.\n\nThe excess minority carrier hole concentrations at the two boundaries are\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_E(x' = 0) = \\delta p_E(0) = C + D\n\\]\n\n(12.19a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_E(x' = x_E) = \\delta p_E(x_E) = C \\exp \\left( \\frac{x_E}{L_E} \\right) + D \\exp \\left( -\\frac{x_E}{L_E} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.19b)\n\nAgain, the B–E junction is forward biased, so\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_E(0) = p_E(x' = 0) - p_{E0} = p_{E0} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.20a)\n\nAn infinite surface recombination velocity at \\(x' = x_E\\) implies that\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_E(x_E) = 0\n\\]\n\n(12.20b)\n\nSolving for \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) using Equations (12.19) and (12.20) yields the excess minority carrier hole concentration in Equation (12.18):\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_E(x') = p_{E0} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] \\frac{\\sinh \\left( \\frac{x_E - x'}{L_E} \\right)}{\\sinh \\left( \\frac{x_E}{L_E} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(12.21a)\n\nThis excess concentration will also vary approximately linearly with distance if \\( x_E \\) is small.

If we assume that the collector is long, then the coefficient \\( G \\) must be zero since the excess concentration must remain finite. The second boundary condition gives\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_C(x' = 0) = \\delta p_C(0) = p_C(x' = 0) - p_{C0} = 0 - p_{C0} = -p_{C0}\n\\]\n\n(12.25)\n\nThe excess minority carrier hole concentration in the collector is then given as\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_C(x') = -p_{C0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x'}{L_C}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.26)\n\nThis result is exactly what we expect from the results of a reverse-biased pn junction.\n\n### 12.2.2 Other Modes of Operation\n\nThe bipolar transistor can also operate in the cutoff, saturation, or inverse-active mode. We qualitatively discuss the minority carrier distributions for these operating conditions and treat the actual calculations as problems at the end of the chapter.\n\nFigure 12.16a shows the minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor in cutoff. In cutoff, both the B–E and B–C junctions are reverse biased; thus, the minority carrier concentrations are zero at each space charge edge. The emitter and collector regions are assumed to be “long” in this figure, while the base is narrow compared with the minority carrier diffusion length. Since \\( x_B \\ll L_B \\), essentially all minority carriers are swept out of the base region.\n\nFigure 12.16b shows the minority carrier distribution in the npn bipolar transistor operating in saturation. Both the B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased; thus, excess minority carriers exist at the edge of each space charge region. However, since a collector current still exists when the transistor is in saturation, a gradient will still exist in the minority carrier electron concentration in the base.\n\nFinally, Figure 12.17a shows the minority carrier distribution in the npn transistor for the inverse-active mode. In this case, the B–E is reverse biased and the B–C is forward biased. Electrons from the collector are now injected into the base. The gradient in the minority carrier electron concentration in the base is in the opposite direction.\n\n**Figure 12.16** | Minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in (a) cutoff and (b) saturation.\n\n**Figure 12.17** | (a) Minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the inverse-active mode.

    "text": "## 12.3 Transistor Currents and Low-Frequency Common-Base Current Gain\n\nThe basic principle of operation of the bipolar transistor is the control of the collector current by the B–E voltage. The collector current is a function of the number of majority carriers reaching the collector after being injected from the emitter across the B–E junction. The **common-base current gain** is defined as the ratio of collector current to emitter current. The flow of various charged carriers leads to definitions of particular currents in the device. We can use these definitions to define the current gain of the transistor in terms of several factors.\n\n### 12.3.1 Current Gain—Contributing Factors\n\nFigure 12.18 shows the various particle flux components in the npn bipolar transistor. We define the various flux components and then consider the resulting currents. Although there seems to be a large number of flux components, we may help clarify the situation by correlating each factor with the minority carrier distributions shown in Figure 12.14.\n\nThe factor \\( J_{E}^{n} \\) is the electron flux injected from the emitter into the base. As the electrons diffuse across the base, a few will recombine with majority carrier holes. The majority carrier holes that are lost by recombination must be replenished from the base terminal. This replacement hole flux is denoted by \\( J_{B}^{R} \\). The electron flux that reaches the collector is \\( J_{C}^{n} \\). The majority carrier holes from the base that are injected back into the emitter result in a hole flux denoted by \\( J_{E}^{p} \\). Some electrons and holes\n\n**Figure 12.18** | Particle current density or flux components in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active mode.\n\n**Figure 12.19** | Current density components in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active mode.\n\nthat are injected into the forward-biased B–E space charge region will recombine in this region. This recombination leads to the electron flux \\( J_{E} \\). Generation of electrons and holes occurs in the reverse-biased B–C junction. This generation yields a hole flux \\( J_{G} \\). Finally, the ideal reverse-saturation current in the B–C junction is denoted by the hole flux \\( J_{C0} \\).\n\nThe corresponding electric current density components in the npn transistor are shown in Figure 12.19 along with the minority carrier distributions for the forward-active mode. The curves are the same as in Figure 12.14. As in the pn junction, the currents in the bipolar transistor are defined in terms of minority carrier diffusion currents. The current densities are defined as follows:\n\n- \\( J_{nE} \\): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier electrons in the base at \\( x = 0 \\).\n- \\( J_{nC} \\): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier electrons in the base at \\( x = x_B \\).\n- \\( J_{nB} \\): The difference between \\( J_{nE} \\) and \\( J_{nC} \\), which is due to the recombination of excess minority carrier electrons with majority carrier holes in the base. The \\( J_{nB} \\) current is the flow of holes into the base to replace the holes lost by recombination.\n- \\( J_{pE} \\): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier holes in the emitter at \\( x' = 0 \\).\n- \\( J_{rE} \\): Due to the recombination of carriers in the forward-biased B–E junction.\n- \\( J_{pC0} \\): Due to the diffusion of minority carrier holes in the collector at \\( x'' = 0 \\).\n- \\( J_{G} \\): Due to the generation of carriers in the reverse-biased B–C junction.\n\nThe currents \\( J_{RB}, J_{E\\ell}, \\) and \\( J_R \\) are B–E junction currents only and do not contribute to the collector current. The currents \\( J_{x0} \\) and \\( J_G \\) are B–C junction currents only. These current components do not contribute to the transistor action or the current gain.\n\nThe dc common-base current gain is defined as\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_0 = \\frac{I_C}{I_E}\n\\]\n\n(12.27)\n\nIf we assume that the active cross-sectional area is the same for the collector and emitter, then we can write the current gain in terms of the current densities, or\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_0 = \\frac{J_C}{J_E} = \\frac{J_{nc} + J_G + J_{x0}}{J_{xE} + J_R + J_{E\\ell}}\n\\]\n\n(12.28)\n\nWe are primarily interested in determining how the collector current will change with a change in emitter current. The small-signal, or sinusoidal, common-base current gain is defined as\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{dJ_C}{dJ_E} = \\frac{J_{nc}}{J_{xE} + J_R + J_{E\\ell}}\n\\]\n\n(12.29)\n\nThe reverse-biased B–C currents, \\( J_G \\) and \\( J_{x0} \\), are not functions of the emitter current. We can rewrite Equation (12.29) in the form\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{J_{xE}}{J_{xE} + J_{E\\ell}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J_{nc}}{J_{nc} + J_R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J_{nc} + J_R}{J_{xE} + J_R + J_{E\\ell}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.30a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\gamma \\alpha_T \\delta\n\\]\n\n(12.30b)\n\nThe factors in Equation (12.30b) are defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\left( \\frac{J_{xE}}{J_{xE} + J_{E\\ell}} \\right) \\quad \\text{= emitter injection efficiency factor}\n\\]\n\n(12.31a)\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_T = \\left( \\frac{J_{nc}}{J_{nc} + J_R} \\right) \\quad \\text{= base transport factor}\n\\]\n\n(12.31b)\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{J_{nc} + J_R}{J_{xE} + J_R + J_{E\\ell}} \\quad \\text{= recombination factor}\n\\]\n\n(12.31c)\n\nWe would like to have the change in collector current be exactly the same as the change in emitter current or, ideally, to have \\( \\alpha = 1 \\). However, a consideration of Equation (12.29) shows that \\( \\alpha \\) will always be less than unity. The goal is to make \\( \\alpha \\) as close to unity as possible. To achieve this goal, we must make each term in Equation (12.30b) as close to unity as possible, since each factor is less than unity.\n\nThe **emitter injection efficiency factor** \\( \\gamma \\) takes into account the minority carrier hole diffusion current in the emitter. This current is part of the emitter current, but does not contribute to the transistor action in that \\( J_{E\\ell} \\) is not part of the collector current. The **base transport factor** \\( \\alpha_T \\) takes into account any recombination of excess minority carrier electrons in the base. Ideally, we want no recombination in the base. The **recombination factor** \\( \\delta \\) takes into account the recombination in the base.\n\n### 12.3.2 Derivation of Transistor Current Components and Current Gain Factors\n\nWe now wish to determine the various transistor current components and each of the gain factors in terms of the electrical and geometrical parameters of the transistor. The results of these derivations show how the various parameters in the transistor influence the electrical properties of the device and point the way to the design of a \"good\" bipolar transistor.\n\n#### Emitter Injection Efficiency Factor\n\nConsider, initially, the emitter injection efficiency factor. We have from Equation (12.31a)\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\left( \\frac{J_{nE}}{J_{nE} + J_{pE}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left( 1 + \\frac{J_{pE}}{J_{nE}} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(12.32)\n\nWe derived the minority carrier distribution functions for the forward-active mode in Section 12.2.1. Noting that \\( J_{pE} \\), as defined in Figure 12.19, is in the negative \\( x \\) direction, we can write the current densities as\n\n\\[\nJ_{pE} = -eD_{E} \\left. \\frac{d\\delta p_{E}(x')}{dx'} \\right|_{x'=0}\n\\]\n\n(12.33a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nJ_{nE} = -eD_{B} \\left. \\frac{d\\delta n_{B}(x)}{dx} \\right|_{x=0}\n\\]\n\n(12.33b)\n\nwhere \\(\\delta p_{E}(x')\\) and \\(\\delta n_{B}(x)\\) are given by Equations (12.21) and (12.15), respectively.\n\nTaking the appropriate derivatives of \\(\\delta p_{E}(x')\\) and \\(\\delta n_{B}(x)\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nJ_{pE} = eD_{pE} \\frac{p_{E0}}{L_{E}} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\tanh (x_{E}/L_{E})}\n\\]\n\n(12.34a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nJ_{nE} = eD_{B} \\frac{n_{B0}}{L_{B}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sinh (x_{B}/L_{B})} + \\frac{\\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1}{\\tanh (x_{B}/L_{B})} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.34b)\n\nPositive \\( J_{pE} \\) and \\( J_{nE} \\) values imply that the currents are in the directions shown in Figure 12.19. If we assume that the B–E junction is biased sufficiently far in the forward bias so that \\( V_{BE} \\gg kT/e \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) \\gg 1\n\\]\n\nand also\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\exp \\left( eV_{BE}/kT \\right)}{\\tanh (x_{B}/L_{B})} \\gg \\frac{1}{\\sinh (x_{B}/L_{B})}\n\\]\n\n#### Transistor Currents and Low-Frequency Common-Base Current Gain\n\nThe emitter injection efficiency, from Equation (12.32), then becomes\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{p_{E0} D_E L_B}{n_{B0} D_B L_E} \\cdot \\frac{\\tanh(x_B/L_B)}{\\tanh(x_E/L_E)}}\n\\]\n\n(12.35a)\n\nIf we assume that all the parameters in Equation (12.35a) except \\(p_{E0}\\) and \\(n_{B0}\\) are fixed, then in order for \\(\\gamma \\approx 1\\), we must have \\(p_{E0} \\ll n_{B0}\\). We can write\n\n\\[\np_{E0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_E} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_{B0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_B}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(N_E\\) and \\(N_B\\) are the impurity doping concentrations in the emitter and base, respectively. Then the condition that \\(p_{E0} \\ll n_{B0}\\) implies that \\(N_E \\gg N_B\\). For the emitter injection efficiency to be close to unity, the emitter doping must be large compared to the base doping. This condition means that many more electrons from the n-type emitter than holes from the p-type base will be injected across the B–E space charge region. If both \\(x_B \\ll L_B\\) and \\(x_E \\ll L_E\\), then the emitter injection efficiency can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\gamma \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{N_B}{N_E} \\cdot \\frac{D_E}{D_B} \\cdot \\frac{x_B}{x_E}}\n\\]\n\n(12.35b)\n\n#### Base Transport Factor\n\nThe next term to consider is the base transport factor, given by Equation (12.31b) as \\(\\alpha_T = J_{C}/J_{E}\\). From the definitions of the current directions shown in Figure 12.19, we can write\n\n\\[\nJ_{C} = (-e) D_B \\left. \\frac{d[n_B(x)]}{dx} \\right|_{x=x_B}\n\\]\n\n(12.36a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nJ_{xE} = (-e)D_{B} \\left. \\frac{d\\delta n_{B}(x)}{dx} \\right|_{x=0}\n\\]\n\n(12.36b)\n\nUsing the expression for \\(\\delta n_{B}(x)\\) given in Equation (12.15), we find that\n\n\\[\nJ_{nC} = \\frac{eD_{B}n_{B0}}{L_{B}} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] \\frac{1}{\\sinh(x_{B}/L_{B})} = \\frac{1}{\\tanh(x_{B}/L_{B})}\n\\]\n\n(12.37)\n\nThe expression for \\(J_{xE}\\) is given in Equation (12.34a).\n\nIf we again assume that the B–E junction is biased sufficiently far in the forward bias so that \\(V_{BE} \\gg kT/e\\), then \\(\\exp(eV_{BE}/kT) \\gg 1\\). Substituting Equations (12.37) and (12.34b) into Equation (12.31b), we have\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{T} = \\frac{J_{nC}}{J_{xE}} = \\frac{\\exp(eV_{BE}/kT) + \\cosh(x_{B}/L_{B})}{1 + \\exp(eV_{BE}/kT) \\cosh(x_{B}/L_{B})}\n\\]\n\n(12.38)\n\nIn order for \\(\\alpha_{T}\\) to be close to unity, the neutral base width \\(x_{B}\\) must be much smaller than the minority carrier diffusion length in the base \\(L_{B}\\). If \\(x_{B} \\ll L_{B}\\), then \\(\\cosh(x_{B}/L_{B})\\) will be just slightly greater than unity. In addition, if \\(\\exp(eV_{BE}/kT) \\gg 1\\), then the base transport factor is approximately\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{T} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x_{B}/L_{B})}\n\\]\n\n(12.39a)\n\nFor \\(x_{B} \\ll L_{B}\\), we may expand the cosh function in a Taylor series, so that\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{T} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x_{B}/L_{B})} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2}(x_{B}/L_{B})^{2}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(x_{B}/L_{B})^{2}\n\\]\n\n(12.39b)\n\nThe base transport factor \\(\\alpha_{T}\\) will be close to one if \\(x_{B} \\ll L_{B}\\). We can now see why we indicated earlier that the neutral base width \\(x_{B}\\) would be less than \\(L_{B}\\).\n\n#### Recombination Factor\n\nThe recombination factor is given by Equation (12.31c). We can write\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{J_{xe} + J_{pe}}{J_{xe} + J_R + J_{pe}} = \\frac{J_{xe}}{J_{xe} + J_R} = \\frac{1}{1 + J_R/J_{xe}}\n\\]\n\n(12.40)\n\nWe have assumed in Equation (12.40) that \\( J_{pe} \\ll J_{xe} \\). The recombination current density, due to the recombination in a forward-biased pn junction, was discussed in Chapter 8 and can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_R = \\frac{e x_{BE} n_i}{2 \\tau_o} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{2kT} \\right) = J_o \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{2kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.41)\n\nwhere \\( x_{BE} \\) is the B–E space charge width.\n\nThe current \\( J_{xe} \\) from Equation (12.34b) can be approximated as\n\n\\[\nJ_{xe} = J_{xo} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.42)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nJ_{xo} = \\frac{e D_B n_{i0}}{L_B \\tanh (x_{B}/L_B)}\n\\]\n\n(12.43)\n\nThe recombination factor, from Equation (12.40), can then be written as\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{J_o}{J_{xo}} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{eV_{BE}}{2kT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n(12.44)\n\nThe recombination factor is a function of the B–E voltage. As \\( V_{BE} \\) increases, the recombination current becomes less dominant and the recombination factor approaches unity.\n\nThe recombination factor must also include surface effects. The surface effects can be described by the surface recombination velocity as we discussed in Chapter 6. Figure 12.20a shows the B–E junction of an npn transistor near the semiconductor surface. We assume that the B–E junction is forward biased. Figure 12.20b shows the excess minority carrier electron concentration in the base along the cross section A–A'. This curve is the usual forward-biased junction minority carrier concentration. Figure 12.20c shows the excess minority carrier electron concentration along the cross section C–C' from the surface. We have showed earlier that the excess concentration at a surface is smaller than the excess concentration in the bulk material. With this electron distribution, there is a diffusion of electrons from the bulk toward the surface where the electrons recombine with the majority carrier holes. Figure 12.20d shows the injection of electrons from the emitter into the base and the diffusion of\n\n**Figure 12.20** | The surface at the E–B junction showing the diffusion of carriers toward the surface.\n\nElectrons toward the surface. This diffusion generates another component of recombination current and this component of recombination current must be included in the recombination factor δ. Although the actual calculation is difficult because of the two-dimensional analysis required, the form of the recombination current is the same as that of Equation (12.41).\n\n### 12.3.3 Summary\n\nAlthough we have considered an npn transistor in all of the derivations, exactly the same analysis applies to a pnp transistor; the same minority carrier distributions are obtained except that the electron concentrations become hole concentrations and vice versa. The current directions and voltage polarities also change.\n\nWe have been considering the common-base current gain, defined in Equation (12.27) as \\( \\alpha = I_C/I_E \\). The common-emitter current gain is defined as \\( \\beta_0 = I_C/I_B \\). From Figure 12.8 we see that \\( I_E = I_B + I_C \\). We can determine the relation between common-emitter and common-base current gains from the KCL equation. We can write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{I_E}{I_C} = \\frac{I_B}{I_C} + 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the definitions of current gains, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha_0} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_0} + 1\n\\]\n\nSince this relation actually holds for both dc and small-signal conditions, we can drop the subscript. The common-emitter current gain can now be written in terms of the common-base current gain as\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\n\\]\n\nThe common-base current gain, in terms of the common-emitter current gain, is found to be\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\n\nTable 12.3 summarizes the expressions for the limiting factors in the common-base current gain assuming that \\( x_B \\ll L_B \\) and \\( x_E^* \\ll L_E \\). Also given are the approximate expressions for the common-base current gain and the common-emitter current gain.\n\n### 12.3.4 Example Calculations of the Gain Factors\n\nIf we assume a typical value of \\( \\beta \\) to be 100, then \\( \\alpha = 0.99 \\). If we also assume that \\( \\gamma = \\alpha_T = \\bar{\\delta} \\), then each factor would have to be equal to 0.9967 in order that \\( \\beta = 100 \\). This calculation gives an indication of how close to unity each factor must be in order to achieve a reasonable current gain.\n\n\n**Table 12.3** | Summary of Limiting Factors\n\n#### Emitter Injection Efficiency\n\n\\[\n\\gamma \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{N_B}{N_E} \\cdot \\frac{D_E}{D_B} \\cdot \\frac{x_B}{x_E}} \\quad (x_B \\ll L_B), (x_E \\ll L_E)\n\\]\n\n#### Base Transport Factor\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_T \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x_B}{L_B} \\right)} \\quad (x_B \\ll L_B)\n\\]\n\n#### Recombination Factor\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{J_{BO}}{J_O} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-eV_{BE}}{2kT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n#### Common-Base Current Gain\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\gamma \\alpha_T \\delta \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{N_B}{N_E} \\cdot \\frac{D_E}{D_B} \\cdot \\frac{x_B}{x_E} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x_B}{L_B} \\right) + \\frac{J_{BO}}{J_O} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-eV_{BE}}{2kT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n#### Common-Emitter Current Gain\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\frac{N_B}{N_E} \\cdot \\frac{D_E}{D_B} \\cdot \\frac{x_B}{x_E} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x_B}{L_B} \\right) + \\frac{J_{BO}}{J_O} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-eV_{BE}}{2kT} \\right)}\n\\]",

    "text": "## 12.4 Nonideal Effects\n\nIn all previous discussions, we have considered a transistor with uniformly doped regions, low injection, constant emitter and base widths, an ideal constant energy bandgap, uniform current densities, and junctions that are not in breakdown. If any of these ideal conditions is not present, then the transistor properties will deviate from the ideal characteristics we have derived.\n\n### 12.4.1 Base Width Modulation\n\nWe have implicitly assumed that the neutral base width \\( x_B \\) is constant. This base width, however, is a function of the B–C voltage, since the width of the space charge region extending into the base region varies with B–C voltage. As the B–C reverse-biased voltage increases, the B–C space charge region width increases, which reduces \\( x_B \\). A change in the neutral base width will change the collector current as can be observed in Figure 12.21. A reduction in base width will cause the gradient in the minority carrier concentration to increase, which in turn causes an increase in the diffusion current. This effect is known as **base width modulation**; it is also called the **Early effect**.\n\nThe Early effect can be seen in the current–voltage characteristics shown in Figure 12.22. In most cases, a constant base current is equivalent to a constant B–E voltage. Ideally the collector current is independent of the B–C voltage so that the slope of the curves would be zero; thus, the output conductance of the transistor would be zero. However, the base width modulation, or Early effect, produces a nonzero slope and gives rise to a finite output conductance. If the collector current characteristics are extrapolated to zero collector current, the curves intersect the voltage axis at a point that is defined as the Early voltage. The Early voltage is considered to be a positive value. It is a common parameter given in transistor specifications; typical values of Early voltage are in the 100- to 300-V range.\n\n**Figure 12.21** The change in the base width and the change in the minority carrier gradient as the B–C space charge width changes.\n\n*The collector current versus collector–emitter voltage showing the Early effect and Early voltage.*\n\nFrom Figure 12.22, we can write that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dI_C}{dV_{CE}} = g_o = \\frac{I_C}{V_{CE} + V_A} = \\frac{1}{r_o}\n\\]\n\n(12.45a)\n\nwhere \\( V_A \\) and \\( V_{CE} \\) are defined as positive quantities, \\( g_o \\) is defined as the output conductance, and \\( r_o \\) is defined as the output resistance. Equation (12.45a) can be rewritten in the form\n\n\\[\nI_C = g_o (V_{CE} + V_A) = \\frac{1}{r_o} (V_{CE} + V_A)\n\\]\n\n(12.45b)\n\nshowing that the collector current is now an explicit function of the collector–emitter voltage or the collector–base voltage.\n\nThe previous example and exercise problem demonstrate, too, that we can expect variations in transistor properties due to tolerances in transistor-fabrication processes. There will be variations, in particular, in the base width of narrow-base transistors that will cause variations in the collector current characteristics simply due to the tolerances in processing.\n\n### 12.4.2 High Injection\n\nThe ambipolar transport equation that we have used to determine the minority carrier distributions assumed low injection. As \\( V_{BE} \\) increases, the injected minority carrier concentration may approach, or even become larger than, the majority carrier concentration. If we assume quasi–charge neutrality, then the majority carrier hole concentration in the p-type base at \\( x = 0 \\) will increase as shown in Figure 12.23 because of the excess holes.\n\n**Figure 12.23** | Minority and majority carrier concentrations in the base under low and high injection (solid line: low injection; dashed line: high injection).\n\n**Figure 12.24** | Common-emitter current gain versus collector current. *(From Shur [14].)*\n\nTwo effects occur in the transistor at high injection. The first effect is a reduction in emitter injection efficiency. Since the majority carrier hole concentration at \\( x = 0 \\) increases with high injection, more holes are injected back into the emitter because of the forward-biased B–E voltage. An increase in the hole injection causes an increase in the \\( J_{cE} \\) current and an increase in \\( J_{pE} \\) reduces the emitter injection efficiency. The common-emitter current gain decreases, then, with high injection. Figure 12.24 shows a typical common-emitter current gain versus collector current curve. The low gain at low currents is due to the small recombination factor and the drop-off at the high current is due to the high-injection effect.\n\nWe now consider the second high-injection effect. At low injection, the majority carrier hole concentration at \\( x = 0 \\) for the npn transistor is\n\n\\[\np_p(0) = p_{p0} = N_a \\tag{12.46a}\n\\]\n\nand the minority carrier electron concentration is\n\n\\[\nn_p(0) = n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) \\tag{12.46b}\n\\]\n\nThe pn product is\n\n\\[\np_p(0)n_p(0) = p_{p0}n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) \\tag{12.46c}\n\\]\n\nAt high injection, Equation (12.46c) still applies. However, \\( p_p(0) \\) will also increase, and for very high injection it will increase at nearly the same rate as \\( n_p(0) \\). The increase in \\( n_p(0) \\) will asymptotically approach the function\n\n\\[\nn_p(0) \\approx n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{2kT} \\right) \\tag{12.47}\n\\]\n\n\n**Figure 12.25** | Collector current versus base–emitter voltage showing high-injection effects.\n\nThe excess minority carrier concentration in the base, and hence the collector current, will increase at a slower rate with B–E voltage in high injection than low injection. This effect is shown in Figure 12.25. The high-injection effect is very similar to the effect of a series resistance in a pn junction diode.\n\n### 12.4.3 Emitter Bandgap Narrowing\n\nAnother phenomenon affecting the emitter injection efficiency is bandgap narrowing. We have implied from our previous discussion that the emitter injection efficiency factor will continue to increase and approach unity as the ratio of emitter doping to base doping continues to increase. As silicon becomes heavily doped, the discrete donor energy level in an n-type emitter splits into a band of energies. The distance between donor atoms decreases as the concentration of impurity donor atoms increases, and the splitting of the donor level is caused by the interaction of donor atoms with each other. As the doping continues to increase, the donor band widens, becomes skewed, and moves up toward the conduction band, eventually merging with it. At this point, the effective bandgap energy has decreased. Figure 12.26 shows a plot of the change in the bandgap energy with impurity doping concentration.\n\nA reduction in the bandgap energy increases the intrinsic carrier concentration. The intrinsic carrier concentration is given by\n\n\\[\nn_i^2 = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_g}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.48)\n\nIn a heavily doped emitter, the intrinsic carrier concentration can be written as\n\n\\[\nn_{ie}^2 = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_{g0} - \\Delta E_g}{kT}\\right) = n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.49)",

    "text": "## 12.4 Nonideal Effects\n\n**Figure 12.26** | Bandgap narrowing factor versus donor impurity concentration in silicon.  \n*(From Sze [19].)*\n\nwhere \\( E_{g0} \\) is the bandgap energy at a low doping concentration and \\( \\Delta E_g \\) is the bandgap narrowing factor.\n\nThe emitter injection efficiency factor is given by Equation (12.35) as\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{p_{E0} D_p L_B}{n_{D0} D_n L_E} \\tanh(x_B/L_B) \\tanh(x_E/L_E)}\n\\]\n\nThe term \\( p_{E0} \\) is the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentration in the emitter, taking into account bandgap narrowing, and can be written as\n\n\\[\np_{E0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_E} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_E} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{kT}\\right) \\tag{12.50}\n\\]\n\nAs the emitter doping concentration increases, \\( \\Delta E_g \\) increases; thus, \\( p_{E0} \\) does not continue to decrease with increasing emitter doping \\( N_E \\). If \\( p_{E0} \\) starts to increase because of the bandgap narrowing, the emitter injection efficiency begins to fall off instead of continuing to increase with increased emitter doping.\n\nAs the emitter doping increases, the bandgap narrowing factor, \\( \\Delta E_g \\), will increase; this can actually cause \\( p_{E0} \\) to increase. As \\( p_{E0} \\) increases, the emitter injection efficiency decreases; this then causes the transistor gain to decrease, as shown in Figure 12.24. A very high emitter doping may result in a smaller current gain than we anticipate because of the bandgap narrowing effect.\n\n### 12.4.4 Current Crowding\n\nIt is tempting to neglect the effects of base current in a transistor since the base current is usually much smaller than either the collector or the emitter current. Figure 12.27 is a cross section of an npn transistor showing the lateral distribution of base current. The base region is typically less than a micrometer thick, so there can be a sizable base resistance. The nonzero base resistance results in a lateral potential difference under the emitter region. For the npn transistor, the potential decreases from the edge of the emitter toward the center. The emitter is highly doped, so as a first approximation the emitter can be considered an equipotential region.\n\nThe number of electrons from the emitter injected into the base is exponentially dependent on the B–E voltage. With the lateral voltage drop in the base between the edge and center of the emitter, more electrons will be injected near the emitter edges than in the center, causing the emitter current to be crowded toward the edges. This\n\n**Figure 12.27** | Cross section of an npn bipolar transistor showing the base current distribution and the lateral potential drop in the base region.\n\n**Figure 12.28** | Cross section of an npn bipolar transistor showing the emitter current crowding effect.\n\nThe current crowding effect is schematically shown in Figure 12.28. The larger current density near the emitter edge may cause localized heating effects as well as localized high-injection effects. The nonuniform emitter current also results in a nonuniform lateral base current under the emitter. A two-dimensional analysis would be required to calculate the actual potential drop versus distance because of the nonuniform base current. Another approach is to slice the transistor into a number of smaller parallel transistors and to lump the resistance of each base section into an equivalent external resistance.\n\nPower transistors, designed to handle large currents, require large emitter areas to maintain reasonable current densities. To avoid the current crowding effect, these transistors are usually designed with narrow emitter widths and fabricated with an interdigitated design. Figure 12.29 shows the basic geometry. In effect, many narrow emitters are connected in parallel to achieve the required emitter area.\n\n**Figure 12.29** | (a) Top view and (b) cross section of an interdigitated npn bipolar transistor structure.\n\n### *12.4.5 Nonuniform Base Doping\n\nIn the analysis of the bipolar transistor, we have assumed uniformly doped regions. However, uniform doping rarely occurs. Figure 12.31 shows a doping profile in a doubly diffused npn transistor. We can start with a uniformly doped n-type substrate, diffuse acceptor atoms from the surface to form a compensated p-type base, and then diffuse donor atoms from the surface to form a doubly compensated n-type emitter. The diffusion process results in a nonuniform doping profile.\n\nWe determined in Chapter 5 that a graded impurity concentration leads to an induced electric field. For the p-type base region in thermal equilibrium, we can write\n\n\\[\nJ_p = e\\mu_p N_a E - eD_p \\frac{dN_a}{dx} = 0 \\tag{12.51}\n\\]\n\nThen\n\n\\[\nE = + \\left( \\frac{kT}{e} \\right) \\frac{1}{N_a} \\frac{dN_a}{dx} \\tag{12.52}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the example of Figure 12.31, \\( dN_a/dx \\) is negative; hence, the induced electric field is in the negative \\( x \\) direction.\n\n**Figure 12.31** | Impurity concentration profiles of a double-diffused npn bipolar transistor.\n\nElectrons are injected from the n-type emitter into the base, and the minority carrier base electrons begin diffusing toward the collector region. The induced electric field in the base, because of the nonuniform doping, produces a force on the electrons in the direction toward the collector. The induced electric field, then, aids the flow of minority carriers across the base region. This electric field is called an **accelerating field**.\n\nThe accelerating field will produce a drift component of current that is in addition to the existing diffusion current. Since the minority carrier electron concentration varies across the base, the drift current density will not be constant. The total current across the base, however, is nearly constant. The induced electric field in the base due to nonuniform base doping will alter the minority carrier distribution through the base so that the sum of drift current and diffusion current will be constant. Calculations have shown that the uniformly doped base theory is very useful for estimating the base characteristics.\n\n### 12.4.6 Breakdown Voltage\n\nThere are two breakdown mechanisms to consider in a bipolar transistor. The first is called punch-through. As the reverse-biased B–C voltage increases, the B–C space charge region widens and extends farther into the neutral base. It is possible for the B–C depletion region to penetrate completely through the base and reach the B–E space charge region, the effect called **punch-through**. Figure 12.32a shows the energy-band diagram of an npn bipolar transistor in thermal equilibrium, and Figure 12.32b shows the energy-band diagram for two values of reverse-biased B–C junction voltage. When a small C–B voltage, \\(V_{CB}\\), is applied, the B–E potential barrier is not affected; thus, the transistor current is still essentially zero. When a large reverse-biased voltage, \\(V_{CB}\\), is applied, the depletion region extends through the base region and the B–E potential barrier is lowered because of the C–B voltage. The lowering of the potential barrier at the B–E junction produces a large increase in current with a very small increase in C–B voltage. This effect is the punch-through breakdown phenomenon.\n\n**Figure 12.32** | Energy-band diagram of an npn bipolar transistor (a) in thermal equilibrium, and (b) with a reverse-biased B–C voltage before punch-through, \\(V_{R1}\\), and after punch-through, \\(V_{R2}\\).\n\n**Figure 12.33** | Geometry of a bipolar transistor to calculate the punch-through voltage.\n\nFigure 12.33 shows the geometry for calculating the punch-through voltage. Assume that \\(N_B\\) and \\(N_C\\) are the uniform impurity doping concentrations in the base and collector, respectively. Let \\(x_{B0}\\) be the metallurgical width of the base and let \\(x_{dB}\\) be the space charge width extending into the base from the B–C junction. If we neglect the narrow space charge width of a zero-biased or forward-biased B–E junction, then punch-through, assuming the abrupt junction approximation, occurs when \\(x_{dB} = x_{B0}\\). We can write that\n\n\\[\nx_{dB} = x_{B0} = \\left\\{ \\frac{2 \\varepsilon (V_{bi} + V_{pt})}{e} \\cdot \\frac{N_C}{N_B} \\cdot \\frac{1}{N_C + N_B} \\right\\}^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n(12.53)\n\nwhere \\(V_{pt}\\) is the reverse-biased B–C voltage at punch-through. Neglecting \\(V_{bi}\\) compared to \\(V_{pt}\\), we can solve for \\(V_{pt}\\) as\n\n\\[\nV_{pt} = \\frac{e x_{B0}^2}{2 \\varepsilon} \\cdot \\frac{N_B (N_C + N_B)}{N_C}\n\\]\n\n(12.54)\n\nThe base and collector doping concentrations are \\( N_B = 5 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\) and \\( N_C = 2 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} \\), respectively. \n\n(a) Determine the punch-through voltage.  \n(b) What is the expected avalanche breakdown voltage?  \n[Answer: (a) 81 V; (b) 519 V]\n\nThe second breakdown mechanism to consider is avalanche breakdown, but taking into account the gain of the transistor. Figure 12.34a is an npn transistor with a reverse-biased voltage applied to the B–C junction and with the emitter left open. The current \\( I_{BCO} \\) is the reverse-biased junction current. Figure 12.34b shows the transistor with an applied C–E voltage and with the base terminal left open. This bias\n\n*The doping concentrations in the base and collector of the transistor are small enough that Zener breakdown is not a factor to be considered.*\n\n**Figure 12.34** (a) Open-emitter configuration with saturation current \\( I_{CBO} \\); (b) Open-base configuration with saturation current \\( I_{CEO} \\).\n\nThe condition also makes the B–C junction reverse biased. The current in the transistor for this bias configuration is denoted as \\( I_{CBO} \\).\n\nThe current \\( I_{CBO} \\) shown in Figure 12.34b is the normal reverse-biased B–C junction current. Part of this current is due to the flow of minority carrier holes from the collector across the B–C space charge region into the base. The flow of holes into the base makes the base positive with respect to the emitter, and the B–E junction becomes forward biased. The forward-biased B–E junction produces the current \\( I_{EBO} \\) due primarily to the injection of electrons from the emitter into the base. The injected electrons diffuse across the base toward the B–C junction. These electrons are subject to all of the recombination processes in the bipolar transistor. When the electrons reach the B–C junction, this current component is \\( \\alpha I_{CBO} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is the common-base current gain. We therefore have\n\n\\[\nI_{CEO} = \\alpha I_{CBO} + I_{CBO}\n\\]\n\n(12.55a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nI_{CEO} = \\frac{I_{CBO}}{1 - \\alpha} \\approx \\beta I_{CBO}\n\\]\n\n(12.55b)\n\nwhere \\( \\beta \\) is the common-emitter current gain. The reverse-biased junction current \\( I_{CBO} \\) is multiplied by the current gain \\( \\beta \\) when the transistor is biased in the open-base configuration.\n\nWhen the transistor is biased in the open-emitter configuration as in Figure 12.34a, the current \\( I_{CBO} \\) at breakdown becomes \\( I_{CBO} \\rightarrow MI_{CBO} \\), where \\( M \\) is the multiplication factor. An empirical approximation for the multiplication factor is usually written as\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{1}{1 - (V_{CB}/BV_{CBO})^n}\n\\]\n\n(12.56)\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is an empirical constant, usually between 3 and 6, and \\( BV_{CBO} \\) is the B–C breakdown voltage with the emitter left open.\n\nWhen the transistor is biased with the base open circuited as shown in Figure 12.34b, the currents in the B–C junction at breakdown are multiplied, so that\n\n\\[\nI_{CEO} = M(\\alpha I_{CBO} + I_{CBO})\n\\]\n\n(12.57)\n\nSolving for \\( I_{CEO} \\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_{CEO} = \\frac{MI_{CBO}}{1 - \\alpha M}\n\\]\n\n(12.58)\n\n**Figure 12.35** | Relative breakdown voltages and saturation currents of the open-base and open-emitter configurations.\n\nThe condition for breakdown corresponds to\n\n\\[\n\\alpha M = 1\n\\]\n\n(12.59)\n\nUsing Equation (12.56) and assuming that \\( V_{CB} \\approx V_{CE} \\), Equation (12.59) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1 - (BV_{CBO}/BV_{CEO})^n} = 1\n\\]\n\n(12.60)\n\nwhere \\( BV_{CEO} \\) is the C–E voltage at breakdown in the open-base configuration. Solving for \\( BV_{CEO} \\), we find\n\n\\[\nBV_{CEO} = BV_{CBO} \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha}\n\\]\n\n(12.61)\n\nwhere, again, \\( \\alpha \\) is the common-base current gain. The common-emitter and common-base current gains are related by\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\n\\]\n\n(12.62a)\n\nNormally \\( \\alpha \\approx 1 \\), so that\n\n\\[\n1 - \\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{\\beta}\n\\]\n\n(12.62b)\n\nThen Equation (12.61) can be written as\n\n\\[\nBV_{CEO} = \\frac{BV_{CBO}}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\n\\]\n\n(12.63)\n\nThe breakdown voltage in the open-base configuration is smaller, by the factor \\(\\sqrt{\\beta}\\), than the actual avalanche junction breakdown voltage. This characteristic is shown in Figure 12.35.",

    "text": "## 12.5 Equivalent Circuit Models\n\nIn order to analyze a transistor circuit either by hand calculations or using computer codes, one needs a mathematical model, or equivalent circuit, of the transistor. There are several possible models, each one having certain advantages and disadvantages.\n\nA detailed study of all possible models is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, we will consider three equivalent circuit models. Each of these follows directly from the work we have done on the pn junction diode and on the bipolar transistor. Computer analysis of electronic circuits is more commonly used than hand calculations, but it is instructive to consider the types of transistor model used in computer codes.\n\nIt is useful to divide bipolar transistors into two categories—switching and amplification—defined by their use in electronic circuits. Switching usually involves turning a transistor from its “off” state, or cutoff, to its “on” state, either forward-active or saturation, and then back to its “off” state. Amplification usually involves superimposing sinusoidal signals on dc values so that bias voltages and currents are only perturbed. The **Ebers–Moll model** is used in switching applications; the **hybrid-pi model** is used in amplification applications.\n\n### 12.5.1 Ebers–Moll Model\n\nThe Ebers–Moll model, or equivalent circuit, is one of the classic models of the bipolar transistor. This particular model is based on the interacting diode junctions and is applicable in any of the transistor operating modes. Figure 12.36 shows the current directions and voltage polarities used in the Ebers–Moll model. The currents are defined as all entering the terminals so that\n\n\\[\nI_E + I_B + I_C = 0\n\\]\n\n(12.64)\n\nThe direction of the emitter current is opposite to what we have considered up to this point, but as long as we are consistent in the analysis, the defined direction does not matter.\n\nThe collector current can be written in general as\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\alpha_F I_F - I_{CS}\n\\]\n\n(12.65a)\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha_F\\) is the common-base current gain in the forward-active mode. In this mode, Equation (12.65a) becomes\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\alpha_F I_F + I_{CS}\n\\]\n\n(12.65b)\n\nwhere the current \\(I_{CS}\\) is the reverse-biased B–C junction current. The current \\(I_F\\) is given by\n\n\\[\nI_F = I_{ES} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.66)\n\n\n**Figure 12.36** | Current direction and voltage polarity definitions for the Ebers–Moll model.\n\n\nIf the B–C junction becomes forward biased, such as in saturation, then we can write the current \\( I_R \\) as\n\n\\[\nI_R = I_{CS} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BC}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.67)\n\nUsing Equations (12.66) and (12.67), the collector current from Equation (12.65a) can be written as\n\n\\[\nI_C = \\alpha_F I_{ES} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] - I_{CS} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BC}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.68)\n\nWe can also write the emitter current as\n\n\\[\nI_E = \\alpha_R I_F - I_F\n\\]\n\n(12.69)\n\nor\n\n\\[\nI_E = \\alpha_R I_{CS} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BC}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] - I_{ES} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.70)\n\nThe current \\( I_{ES} \\) is the reverse-biased B–E junction current and \\( \\alpha_R \\) is the common-base current gain for the inverse-active mode. Equations (12.68) and (12.70) are the classic Ebers–Moll equations.\n\nFigure 12.37 shows the equivalent circuit corresponding to Equations (12.68) and (12.70). The current sources in the equivalent circuit represent current components that depend on voltages across other junctions. The Ebers–Moll model has four parameters: \\( \\alpha_F, \\alpha_R, I_{ES}, \\) and \\( I_{CS} \\). However, only three parameters are independent. The reciprocity relationship states that\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_F I_{ES} = \\alpha_R I_{CS}\n\\]\n\n(12.71)\n\nSince the Ebers–Moll model is valid in each of the four operating modes, we can, for example, use the model for the transistor in saturation. In the saturation mode, both B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased, so that \\( V_{BE} > 0 \\) and \\( V_{BC} > 0 \\). The B–E voltage will be a known parameter since we will apply a voltage across this junction. The forward-biased B–C voltage is a result of driving the transistor into saturation and is the unknown to be determined from the Ebers–Moll equations.\n\n**Figure 12.37** | Basic Ebers–Moll equivalent circuit.\n\nNormally in electronic circuit applications, the collector–emitter voltage at saturation is of interest. We can define the C–E saturation voltage as\n\n\\[\nV_{CE(sat)} = V_{BE} - V_{BC}\n\\]\n\n(12.72)\n\nWe find an expression for \\( V_{CE(sat)} \\) by combining the Ebers–Moll equations. In the following example, we see how the Ebers–Moll equations can be used in a hand calculation, and we may also see how a computer analysis would make the calculations easier.\n\nCombining Equations (12.64) and (12.70), we have\n\n\\[\n-(I_B + I_C) = \\alpha_F I_{CS} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] - I_{ES} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BC}}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.73)\n\nIf we solve for \\([\\exp(eV_{BE}/kT) - 1]\\) from Equation (12.73), and substitute the resulting expression into Equation (12.68), we can then find \\( V_{BE} \\) as\n\n\\[\nV_{BE} = V_T \\ln \\left[ \\frac{I_C(1 - \\alpha_R) + I_B + \\frac{I_{CS}(1 - \\alpha_F \\alpha_R)}{I_{CS}(1 - \\alpha_F \\alpha_R)}} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.74)\n\nwhere \\( V_T \\) is the thermal voltage. Similarly, if we solve for \\([\\exp(eV_{BE}/kT) - 1]\\) from Equation (12.68), and substitute this expression into Equation (12.73), we can find \\( V_{BC} \\) as\n\n\\[\nV_{BC} = V_T \\ln \\left[ \\frac{\\alpha_F I_B - (1 - \\alpha_F) I_C + I_{CS}(1 - \\alpha_R \\alpha_F)}{I_{CS}(1 - \\alpha_R \\alpha_F)} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(12.75)\n\nWe may neglect the \\( I_{ES} \\) and \\( I_{CS} \\) terms in the numerators of Equations (12.74) and (12.75).

This model can be used if, for example, there is a nonuniform doping concentration in the base.\n\nThe electron current density in the base of an npn transistor can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_n = e \\mu_n n(x) E + e D_n \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.78)\n\nAn electric field will occur in the base if nonuniform doping exists in the base. This is discussed in Section 12.4.5. The electric field, from Equation (12.52), can be written in the form\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{kT}{e} \\cdot \\frac{1}{p(x)} \\cdot \\frac{dp(x)}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.79)\n\nwhere \\( p(x) \\) is the majority carrier hole concentration in the base. Under low injection, the hole concentration is just the acceptor impurity concentration. With the doping profile shown in Figure 12.31, the electric field is negative (from the collector to the emitter). The direction of this electric field aids the flow of electrons across the base.\n\nSubstituting Equation (12.79) into Equation (12.78), we obtain\n\n\\[\nJ_n = e \\mu_n n(x) \\cdot \\frac{kT}{e} \\cdot \\frac{1}{p(x)} \\cdot \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} + e D_n \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.80)\n\nUsing Einstein’s relation, we can write Equation (12.80) in the form\n\n\\[\nJ_n = e D_n \\left[ \\frac{n(x)}{p(x)} \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} + p(x) \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} \\right] = \\frac{e D_n}{p(x)} \\cdot \\frac{d(pn)}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.81)\n\nEquation (12.81) can be written in the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{J_n p(x)}{e D_n} = \\frac{d(pn)}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.82)\n\nIntegrating Equation (12.82) through the base region while assuming that the electron current density is essentially a constant and the diffusion coefficient is a constant, we find\n\n\\[\n\\frac{J_n}{e D_n} \\int_0^{x'} p(x) dx = \\int_0^{x'} \\frac{d(p(x)n(x))}{dx} dx = p(x_B)n(x_B) - p(0)n(0)\n\\]\n\n(12.83)\n\nAssuming that the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C junction is reverse biased, we have \\( n(0) = n_{B0} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) \\) and \\( n(x_B) = 0 \\). We may note that \\( n_{B0} p_0 = n_i^2 \\) so that Equation (12.83) can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_n = -\\frac{e D_n n_i^2 \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)}{\\int_0^{x'} p(x) dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.84)\n\nThe integral in the denominator is the total majority carrier charge in the base and is known as the **base Gummel number**, defined as \\( Q_B \\).\n\nIf we perform the same analysis in the emitter, we find that the hole current density in the emitter of an npn transistor can be expressed as\n\n\\[\nJ_p = -eD_p \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_t) \\left/ \\int_0^{x_n} n_{E}^{'c}(x') \\, dx' \\right.\n\\]\n\n(12.85)\n\nThe integral in the denominator is the total majority carrier charge in the emitter and is known as the **emitter Gummel number**, defined as \\( Q_E \\).\n\nSince the currents in the Gummel–Poon model are functions of the total integrated charges in the base and emitter, these currents can easily be determined for nonuniformly doped transistors.\n\nThe Gummel–Poon model can also take into account nonideal effects, such as the Early effect and high-level injection. As the B–C voltage changes, the neutral base width changes so that the base Gummel number \\( Q_B \\) changes. The change in \\( Q_B \\) with B–C voltage then makes the electron current density given by Equation (12.84) a function of the B–C voltage. This is the base width modulation effect or Early effect as discussed previously in Section 12.4.1.\n\nIf the B–E voltage becomes too large, low injection no longer applies, which leads to high-level injection. In this case, the total hole concentration in the base increases because of the increased excess hole concentration. This means that the base Gummel number will increase. The change in base Gummel number implies, from Equation (12.84), that the electron current density will also change. High-level injection has also been previously discussed in Section 12.4.2.\n\nThe Gummel–Poon model can then be used to describe the basic operation of the transistor as well as to describe nonideal effects.\n\n### 12.5.3 Hybrid-Pi Model\n\nBipolar transistors are commonly used in circuits that amplify time-varying or sinusoidal signals. In these linear amplifier circuits, the transistor is biased in the forward-active region and small sinusoidal voltages and currents are superimposed on dc voltages and currents. In these applications, the sinusoidal parameters are of interest, so it is convenient to develop a small-signal equivalent circuit of the bipolar transistor using the small-signal admittance parameters of the pn junction developed in Chapter 8.\n\nFigure 12.38a shows an npn bipolar transistor in a common-emitter configuration with the small-signal terminal voltages and currents. Figure 12.38b shows the cross section of the npn transistor. The C, B, and E terminals are the external connections to the transistor, while the \\( C' \\), \\( B' \\), and \\( E' \\) points are the idealized internal collector, base, and emitter regions.\n\nWe can begin constructing the equivalent circuit of the transistor by considering the various terminals individually. Figure 12.39a shows the equivalent circuit between the external input base terminal and the external emitter terminal. The resistance \\( r_p \\) is the series resistance in the base between the external base terminal B and the internal base region \\( B' \\). The \\( B'–E' \\) junction is forward biased, so \\( C_{\\pi} \\) is\n\n**Figure 12.38** (a) Common-emitter npn bipolar transistor with small-signal current and voltages.

The diffusion capacitance \\( C_e \\) is the same as the diffusion capacitance \\( C_d \\) given by Equation (8.105), and the diffusion resistance \\( r_e \\) is the same as the diffusion resistance \\( r_d \\) given by Equation (8.68). The values of both parameters are functions of the junction.\n\n**Figure 12.40** | Hybrid-pi equivalent circuit.\n\ncurrent. These two elements are in parallel with the junction capacitance, which is \\( C_{\\pi} \\). Finally, \\( r_{ex} \\) is the series resistance between the external emitter terminal and the internal emitter region. This resistance is usually very small and may be on the order of 1 to 2 \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nFigure 12.39b shows the equivalent circuit looking into the collector terminal. The \\( r_c \\) resistance is the series resistance between the external and internal collector connections and the capacitance \\( C_s \\) is the junction capacitance of the reverse-biased collector-substrate junction. The dependent current source, \\( g_m V_{\\pi} \\), is the collector current in the transistor, which is controlled by the internal base–emitter voltage. The resistance \\( r_o \\) is the inverse of the output conductance \\( g_o \\) and is primarily due to the Early effect.\n\nFinally, Figure 12.39c shows the equivalent circuit of the reverse-biased B'–C' junction. The \\( C_{\\mu} \\) parameter is the reverse-biased junction capacitance and \\( r_{\\mu} \\) is the reverse-biased diffusion resistance. Normally, \\( r_{\\mu} \\) is on the order of megohms and can be neglected. The value of \\( C_{\\mu} \\) is usually much smaller than \\( C_{\\pi} \\), but, because of the feedback effect that leads to the Miller effect and Miller capacitance, \\( C_{\\mu} \\) cannot be ignored in most cases. The Miller capacitance is the equivalent capacitance between B' and E' due to \\( C_{\\mu} \\) and the feedback effect, which includes the gain of the transistor. The Miller effect also reflects \\( C_{\\mu} \\) between the C' and E' terminals at the output. However, the effect on the output characteristics can usually be ignored.\n\nFigure 12.40 shows the complete hybrid-pi equivalent circuit. A computer simulation is usually required for this complete model because of the large number of elements. However, some simplifications can be made in order to gain an appreciation for the frequency effects of the bipolar transistor. The capacitances lead to frequency effects in the transistor, which means that the gain, for example, is a function of the input signal frequency.",

    "text": "## 12.6 Frequency Limitations\n\nThe hybrid-pi equivalent circuit, developed in the last section, introduces frequency effects through the capacitor–resistor circuits. We now discuss the various physical factors in the bipolar transistor affecting the frequency limitations of the device and then define the transistor cutoff frequency, which is a figure of merit for a transistor.\n\n### 12.6.1 Time-Delay Factors\n\nThe bipolar transistor is a transit-time device. When the voltage across the B–E junction increases, for example, additional carriers from the emitter are injected into the base, diffuse across the base, and are collected in the collector region. As the frequency increases, this transit time can become comparable to the period of the input signal. At this point, the output response will no longer be in phase with the input and the magnitude of the current gain will decrease.\n\nThe total emitter-to-collector time constant or delay time is composed of four separate time constants. We can write\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{ec} = \\tau_{\\pi} + \\tau_b + \\tau_d + \\tau_c\n\\]\n\n(12.86)\n\nwhere\n\n- \\(\\tau_{ec}\\) = emitter-to-collector time delay\n- \\(\\tau_{\\pi}\\) = emitter–base junction capacitance charging time\n- \\(\\tau_b\\) = base transit time\n- \\(\\tau_d\\) = collector depletion region transit time\n- \\(\\tau_c\\) = collector capacitance charging time\n\nThe equivalent circuit of the forward-biased B–E junction is given in Figure 12.39a. The capacitance \\(C_{\\pi}\\) is the junction capacitance. If we ignore the series resistance, then the emitter–base junction capacitance charging time is\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{\\pi} = r'_e (C_{\\pi} + C_p)\n\\]\n\n(12.87)\n\nwhere \\(r'_e\\) is the emitter junction or diffusion resistance. The capacitance \\(C_p\\) includes any parasitic capacitance between the base and emitter. The resistance \\(r'_e\\) is found as the inverse of the slope of the \\(I_E\\) versus \\(V_{BE}\\) curve. We obtain\n\n\\[\nr'_e = \\frac{kT}{e} \\cdot \\frac{1}{I_E}\n\\]\n\n(12.88)\n\nwhere \\(I_E\\) is the dc emitter current.\n\nThe second term, \\(\\tau_b\\), is the base transit time, the time required for the minority carriers to diffuse across the neutral base region. The base transit time is related to the diffusion capacitance \\(C_f\\) of the B–E junction. For the npn transistor, the electron current density in the base can be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_n = -en(x)v(x)\n\\]\n\n(12.89)\n\nwhere \\(v(x)\\) is an average velocity. We can write\n\n\\[\nv(x) = dx/dt \\quad \\text{or} \\quad dt = dx/v(x)\n\\]\n\n(12.90)\n\n\nThe transit time can then be found by integrating, or\n\n\\[\n\\tau_b = \\int_0^{x_b} \\frac{dx}{v(x)} = \\int_0^{x_b} \\frac{n_B(x) \\, dx}{(-J_n)}\n\\]\n\n(12.91)\n\nThe electron concentration in the base is approximately linear (see Equation (12.15b)) so we can write\n\n\\[\nn_B(x) \\approx n_{B0} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{BE}}{kT} \\right) \\right] \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{x_B} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.92)\n\nand the electron current density is given by\n\n\\[\nJ_n = eD_n \\frac{dn_B(x)}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.93)\n\nThe base transit time is then found by combining Equations (12.92) and (12.93) with Equation (12.91). We find that\n\n\\[\n\\tau_b = \\frac{x_B^2}{2D_n}\n\\]\n\n(12.94)\n\nThe third time-delay factor is \\(\\tau_d\\), the collector depletion region transit time. Assuming that the electrons in the npn device travel across the B–C space charge region at their saturation velocity, we have\n\n\\[\n\\tau_d = \\frac{x_{dc}}{v_s}\n\\]\n\n(12.95)\n\nwhere \\(x_{dc}\\) is the B–C space charge width and \\(v_s\\) is the electron saturation velocity.\n\nThe fourth time-delay factor, \\(\\tau_c\\), is the collector capacitance charging time. The B–C is reverse biased so that the diffusion resistance in parallel with the junction capacitance is very large. The charging time constant is then a function of the collector series resistance \\(r_c\\). We can write\n\n\\[\n\\tau_c = r_c(C_{jc} + C_s)\n\\]\n\n(12.96)\n\nwhere \\(C_{jc}\\) is the B–C junction capacitance and \\(C_s\\) is the collector-to-substrate capacitance. The series resistance in small epitaxial transistors is usually small; thus, the time delay \\(\\tau_c\\) may be neglected in some cases.\n\nExample calculations of the various time-delay factors are given in the next section as part of the cutoff frequency discussion.\n\n### 12.6.2 Transistor Cutoff Frequency\n\nThe current gain as a function of frequency is developed in Example 12.13 so that we can also write the common-base current gain as\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\alpha_0}{1 + j\\frac{f}{f_{\\alpha}}}\n\\]\n\n(12.97)\n\nwhere \\( \\alpha_0 \\) is the low-frequency common-base current gain and \\( f_{\\alpha} \\) is defined as the **alpha cutoff frequency**. The frequency \\( f_{\\alpha} \\) is related to the emitter-to-collector time delay \\( \\tau_{ec} \\) as\n\n\\[\nf_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_{ec}}\n\\]\n\n(12.98)\n\nWhen the frequency is equal to the alpha cutoff frequency, the magnitude of the common-base current gain is \\( 1/\\sqrt{2} \\) of its low-frequency value.\n\nWe can relate the alpha cutoff frequency to the common-emitter current gain by considering\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\n\\]\n\n(12.99)\n\nWe may replace \\( \\alpha \\) in Equation (12.99) with the expression given by Equation (12.97). When the frequency \\( f \\) is of the same order of magnitude as \\( f_{\\alpha} \\), then\n\n\\[\n|\\beta| = \\left| \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right| \\approx \\frac{f_{\\alpha}}{f}\n\\]\n\n(12.100)\n\nwhere we have assumed that \\( \\alpha_0 \\approx 1 \\). When the signal frequency is equal to the alpha cutoff frequency, the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain is equal to unity. The usual notation is to define this **cutoff frequency** as \\( f_T \\), so we have\n\n\\[\nf_T = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_{ec}}\n\\]\n\n(12.101)\n\nFrom the analysis in Example 12.13, we may also write the common-emitter current gain as\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\beta_0}{1 + j(f/f_{\\beta})}\n\\]\n\n(12.102)\n\nwhere \\( f_{\\beta} \\) is called the **beta cutoff frequency** and is the frequency at which the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain \\( \\beta \\) drops to \\( 1/\\sqrt{2} \\) of its low-frequency value.\n\nCombining Equations (12.99) and (12.97), we can write\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha_0}{1 + j(f/f_{\\beta})} = \\frac{\\alpha_0}{1 - \\alpha_0 + j(f/f_T)}\n\\]\n\n(12.103)\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha_0}{(1-\\alpha_0)\\left[1 + j\\frac{f}{(1-\\alpha_0)f_T}\\right]} \\approx \\frac{\\beta_0}{1 + j\\frac{\\beta_0 f}{f_T}}\n\\]\n\n(12.104)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\beta_0 = \\frac{\\alpha_0}{1-\\alpha_0} \\approx \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha_0}\n\\]\n\n**Figure 12.42** Bode plot of common-emitter current gain versus frequency.\n\nComparing Equations (12.104) and (12.102), the beta cutoff frequency is related to the cutoff frequency by\n\n\\[\nf_{\\beta} = \\frac{f_T}{\\beta_0}\n\\]\n\n(12.105)\n\nFigure 12.42 shows a Bode plot of the common-emitter current gain as a function of frequency and shows the relative values of the beta and cutoff frequencies. Keep in mind that the frequency is plotted on a log scale, so \\( f_{\\beta} \\) and \\( f_T \\) usually have significantly different values.",

    "text": "## 12.7 LARGE-SIGNAL SWITCHING\n\nSwitching a transistor from one state to another is strongly related to the frequency characteristics just discussed. However, switching is considered to be a large-signal change, whereas the frequency effects assumed only small changes in the magnitude of the signal.\n\n### 12.7.1 Switching Characteristics\n\nConsider an npn transistor in the circuit shown in Figure 12.43a switching from cutoff to saturation, and then switching back from saturation to cutoff. We describe the physical processes taking place in the transistor during the switching cycle.\n\nConsider, initially, the case of switching from cutoff to saturation. Assume that in cutoff \\(V_{BE} = V_{BB} < 0\\), thus the B–E junction is reverse biased. At \\(t = 0\\), assume that \\(V_{BB}\\) switches to a value of \\(V_{BB0}\\) as shown in Figure 12.43b. We assume that \\(V_{BB0}\\) is sufficiently positive to eventually drive the transistor into saturation. For \\(0 \\leq t \\leq t_1\\), the base current supplies charge to bring the B–E junction from reverse bias to a slight forward bias. The space charge width of the B–E junction is narrowing, and ionized donors and acceptors are being neutralized. A small amount of charge is also...\n\n**Figure 12.43** (a) Circuit used for transistor switching. (b) Input base drive for transistor switching. (c) Collector current versus time during transistor switching.\n\nInjected into the base during this time. The collector current increases from zero to 10 percent of its final value during this time period, referred to as the delay time.\n\nDuring the next time period, \\( t_1 \\leq t \\leq t_2 \\), the base current is supplying charge, which increases the B–E junction voltage from near cutoff to near saturation. During this time, additional carriers are being injected into the base so that the gradient of the minority carrier electron concentration in the base increases, causing the collector current to increase. We refer to this time period as the rise time, during which the collector current increases from 10 to 90 percent of the final value. For \\( t > t_2 \\), the base drive continues to supply base current, driving the transistor into saturation and establishing the final minority carrier distribution in the device.\n\nThe switching of the transistor from saturation to cutoff involves removing all of the excess minority carriers stored in the emitter, base, and collector regions. Figure 12.44 shows the charge storage in the base and collector when the transistor is in saturation. The charge \\( Q_B \\) is the excess charge stored in a forward-active transistor, and \\( Q_{BX} \\) and \\( Q_C \\) are the extra charges stored when the transistor is biased in saturation. At \\( t = t_3 \\), the base voltage \\( V_{BB} \\) switches to a negative value of \\( -V_{RX} \\). The base current in the transistor reverses direction as was the case in switching a pn junction diode from forward to reverse bias. The reverse base current pulls the excess stored carriers from the emitter and base regions. Initially, the collector current does not change significantly, since the gradient of the minority carrier concentration in the base does not.\n\n**Figure 12.44** | Charge storage in the base and collector at saturation and in the active mode.\n\nChange instantaneously. Recall that when the transistor is biased in saturation, both the B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased. The charge \\( Q_{BX} \\) in the base must be removed to reduce the forward-biased B–C voltage to 0 V before the collector current can change. This time delay is called the **storage time** and is denoted by \\( t_s \\). The storage time is the time between the point at which \\( V_{BE} \\) switches to the time when the collector current is reduced to 90 percent of its maximum saturation value. The storage time is usually the most important parameter in the switching speed of the bipolar transistor.\n\nThe final switching delay time is the **fall time** \\( t_f \\) during which the collector current decreases from the 90 percent to the 10 percent value. During this time, the B–C junction is reverse biased but excess carriers in the base are still being removed, and the B–E junction voltage is decreasing.\n\nThe switching-time response of the transistor can be determined by using the Ebers–Moll model. The frequency-dependent gain parameters must be used, and normally the Laplace transform technique is used to obtain the time response. The details of this analysis are quite tedious and are presented here.\n\n### 12.7.2 The Schottky-Clamped Transistor\n\nOne method frequently employed to reduce the storage time and increase the switching speed is the use of a Schottky-clamped transistor. This is a normal npn bipolar device with a Schottky diode connected between base and collector, as shown in Figure 12.45a. The circuit symbol for the Schottky-clamped transistor is shown in Figure 12.45b. When the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, the B–C junction is reverse biased; hence, the Schottky diode is reverse biased and effectively out of the circuit. The characteristics of the Schottky-clamped transistor—or simply the Schottky transistor—are those of the normal npn bipolar device.\n\nWhen the transistor is driven into saturation, the B–C junction becomes forward biased; hence, the Schottky diode also becomes forward biased. We may recall from our discussion in Chapter 9 that the effective turn-on voltage of the Schottky diode is approximately half that of the pn junction. The difference in turn-on voltage means that most of the excess base current is shunted through the Schottky diode and away from the B–C junction.\n\n(a) The Schottky-clamped transistor. (b) Circuit symbol of the Schottky-clamped transistor.\n\nfrom the base so that the amount of excess stored charge in the base and collector is drastically reduced. The excess minority carrier concentration in the base and collector at the B–C junction is an exponential function of \\( V_{BC} \\). If \\( V_{BC} \\) is reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 V, for example, the excess minority carrier concentration is reduced by over three orders of magnitude. The reduced excess stored charge in the base of the Schottky transistor greatly reduces the storage time—storage times on the order of 1 ns or less are common in Schottky transistors.",

    "text": "## *12.8 | Other Bipolar Transistor Structures\n\nThis section is intended to briefly introduce three specialized bipolar transistor structures. The first structure is the polysilicon emitter bipolar junction transistor (BJT), the second is the SiGe-base transistor, and the third is the heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT). The polysilicon emitter BJT is being used in some recent integrated circuits, and the SiGe-base transistor and HBT are intended for high-frequency/high-speed applications.\n\n### 12.8.1 Polysilicon Emitter BJT\n\nThe emitter injection efficiency is degraded by the carriers injected from the base back into the emitter. The emitter width, in general, is thin, which increases speed and reduces parasitic resistance. However, a thin emitter increases the gradient in the minority carrier concentration, as indicated in Figure 12.19. The increase in the gradient increases the B–E junction current, which in turn decreases the emitter injection efficiency and decreases the common-emitter current gain. This effect is also shown in the summary of Table 12.3.\n\nFigure 12.46 shows the idealized cross section of an npn bipolar transistor with a polysilicon emitter. As shown in the figure, there is a very thin \\( n^+ \\) single-crystal silicon region between the p-type base and the n-type polysilicon. As a first approximation to the analysis, we may treat the polysilicon portion of the emitter as low-mobility silicon, which means that the corresponding diffusion coefficient is small.\n\n**Figure 12.46** | Simplified cross section of an npn polysilicon emitter BJT.\n\nIf the neutral widths of both the polysilicon and single-crystal portions of the emitter are much smaller than the respective diffusion lengths, then the minority carrier distribution functions will be linear in each region. Both the minority carrier concentration and diffusion current must be continuous across the polysilicon/silicon interface. We can therefore write\n\n\\[\neD_{E(\\text{poly})} \\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{poly})})}{dx} = eD_{E(\\text{cr})} \\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{cr})})}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.106a)\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{cr})})}{dx} = \\frac{D_{E(\\text{poly})}}{D_{E(\\text{cr})}} \\cdot \\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{poly})})}{dx}\n\\]\n\n(12.106b)\n\nSince \\( D_{E(\\text{poly})} < D_{E(\\text{cr})} \\), then the gradient of the minority carrier concentration at the emitter edge of the B–E depletion region in the \\( n^+ \\) region is reduced as Figure 12.47 shows. This implies that the current back-injected from the base into the emitter is reduced so that the common-emitter current gain is increased.\n\n!Excess minority carrier hole concentrations in n+ polysilicon and n+ silicon emitter.\n\n**Figure 12.47** | Excess minority carrier hole concentrations in \\( n^+ \\) polysilicon and \\( n^+ \\) silicon emitter.\n\n### 12.8.2 Silicon–Germanium Base Transistor\n\nThe bandgap energy of germanium (Ge) (~0.67 eV) is significantly smaller than the bandgap energy of silicon (Si) (~1.12 eV). By incorporating Ge into Si, the bandgap energy will decrease compared to pure Si. If Ge is incorporated into the base region of a Si bipolar transistor, the decrease in bandgap energy will influence the device characteristics. The desired Ge concentration profile is to have the largest amount of Ge near the base–collector junction and the least amount of Ge near the base–emitter junction. Figure 12.48a shows an ideal uniform boron doping concentration in the p-type base and a linear Ge concentration profile.\n\nThe energy bands of a SiGe-base npn transistor compared to a Si-base npn transistor, assuming the boron and Ge concentration given in Figure 12.48a, are shown in Figure 12.48b. The emitter–base junctions of the two transistors are essentially identical, since the Ge concentration is very small in this region. However, the bandgap energy of the SiGe-base transistor near the base–collector junction is smaller than that of the Si-base transistor. The base current is determined by the base–emitter junction parameters and hence will be essentially the same in the two transistors. This change in bandgap energy will influence the collector current.\n\n\n**Figure 12.48** | (a) Assumed boron and germanium concentrations in the base of the SiGe-base transistor. (b) Energy-band diagram of the Si- and SiGe-base transistors.\n\n#### Collector Current and Current Gain Effects\n\nFigure 12.49 shows the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration through the base region of the SiGe and Si transistors. This concentration is given by\n\n\\[\nn_{bo} = \\frac{{n_i^2}}{{N_B}}\n\\]\n\n(12.107)\n\nwhere \\( N_B \\) is assumed to be constant. The intrinsic concentration, however, is a function of the bandgap energy. We may write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{n_i^2(\\text{SiGe})}}{{n_i^2(\\text{Si})}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{{\\Delta E_g}}{{kT}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(12.108)\n\nwhere \\( n_i(\\text{SiGe}) \\) is the intrinsic carrier concentration in the SiGe material, \\( n_i(\\text{Si}) \\) is the intrinsic carrier concentration in the Si material, and \\( \\Delta E_g \\) is the change in the bandgap energy of the SiGe material compared to that of Si.\n\nThe collector current in a SiGe-base transistor will increase. As a first approximation, we can see this from the previous analysis. The collector current is found from Equation (12.36a), in which the derivative is evaluated at the base–collector junction. This means that the value of \\( n_{bo} \\) in the collector current expression in Equation (12.37) is made at the base–collector junction. Since this value is larger for the SiGe-base transistor (Figure 12.49), the collector current will be larger compared to the Si-base transistor. Since the base currents are the same in the two transistors, the increase in collector current then implies that the current gain in the SiGe-base transistor is larger. If the bandgap narrowing is 100 meV, then the increase in the collector current and current gain will be approximately a factor of 4.\n\n#### Early Voltage Effects\n\nThe Early voltage in a SiGe-base transistor is larger than that of the Si-base transistor. The explanation for this effect is less obvious than the explanation for the increase in collector current and current gain. For a bandgap narrowing of 100 meV, the Early voltage is increased by approximately a factor of 12. Incorporating Ge into the base region can increase the Early voltage by a large factor.\n\n**Figure 12.49** | Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration through the base of the Si- and SiGe-base transistors.\n\n#### Base Transit Time and Emitter–Base Charging Time Effects\n\nThe decrease in bandgap energy from the base–emitter junction to the base–collector junction induces an electric field in the base that helps accelerate electrons across the p-type base region. For a bandgap narrowing of 100 meV, the induced electric field can be on the order of \\(10^3\\) to \\(10^4\\) V/cm. This electric field reduces the base transit time by approximately a factor of 2.5.\n\nThe emitter–base junction charging time constant, given by Equation (12.87), is directly proportional to the emitter diffusion resistance \\(r'\\). This parameter is inversely proportional to the emitter current, as seen in Equation (12.88). For a given base current, the emitter current in the SiGe-base transistor is larger, since the current gain is larger. The emitter–base junction charging time is then smaller in a SiGe-base transistor than that in a Si-base transistor.\n\nThe reduction in both the base transit time and the emitter–base charging time increases the cutoff frequency of the SiGe-base transistor. The cutoff frequency of these devices can be substantially higher than that of the Si-base device.\n\n### 12.8.3 Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors\n\nAs mentioned previously, one of the basic limitations of the current gain in the bipolar transistor is the emitter injection efficiency. The emitter injection efficiency \\(\\gamma\\) can be increased by reducing the value of the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentration \\(p_{en}\\) in the emitter. However, as the emitter doping increases, the bandgap narrowing effect offsets any improvement in the emitter injection efficiency. One possible solution is to use a wide-bandgap material for the emitter, which will minimize the injection of carriers from the base back into the emitter.\n\nFigure 12.50a shows a discrete aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)/gallium arsenide (GaAs) heterojunction bipolar transistor, and Figure 12.50b shows the energy-band diagram of the n-AlGaAs emitter to p-GaAs base junction. The large potential barrier \\(V_a\\) limits the number of holes that will be injected back from the base into the emitter.\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of bandgap energy as\n\n\\[\nn_i^2 \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nFor a given emitter doping, the number of minority carrier holes injected into the emitter is reduced by a factor of\n\n\\[\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nin changing from a narrow- to wide-bandgap emitter. If \\(\\Delta E_g = 0.30 \\, \\text{eV}\\), for example, \\(n_i^2\\) would be reduced by approximately \\(10^5\\) at \\(T = 300 \\, \\text{K}\\). The drastic reduction in \\(n_i^2\\) for the wide-bandgap emitter means that the requirements of a very high emitter doping can be relaxed and a high emitter injection efficiency can still be obtained. A lower emitter doping reduces the bandgap narrowing effect.\n\nThe heterojunction GaAs bipolar transistor has the potential of being a very high-frequency device. A lower emitter doping in the wide-bandgap emitter leads to\n\n**Figure 12.50** (a) Cross section of AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor showing a discrete and integrated structure. (b) Energy-band diagram of the n-AlGaAs emitter and p-GaAs base junction. *(From Tiwari et al. [20].)*\n\nA smaller junction capacitance increases the speed of the device. Also, for the GaAs npn device, the minority carriers in the base are electrons with a high mobility. The electron mobility in GaAs is approximately five times that in silicon; thus, the base transit time in the GaAs base is very short. Experimental AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction transistors with base widths on the order of 0.1 μm have shown cutoff frequencies on the order of 40 GHz.\n\nOne disadvantage of GaAs is the low minority carrier lifetime. The small lifetime is not a factor in the base of a narrow-base device, but results in a larger B–E recombination current, which decreases the recombination factor and reduces the current gain. A current gain of 150 has been reported.",

    "text": "## 12.9 | SUMMARY\n\n- There are two complementary bipolar transistors—npn and pnp. Each transistor has three separately doped regions and two pn junctions. The center region (base) is very narrow, so the two pn junctions are said to be interacting junctions.\n\n- In the forward-active mode, the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C junction is reverse biased. Majority carriers from the emitter are injected into the base where they become minority carriers. These minority carriers diffuse across the base into the B–C space charge region where they are swept into the collector.\n\n- When a transistor is biased in the forward-active mode of operation, the current at one terminal of the transistor (collector current) is controlled by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the transistor (base–emitter voltage). This is the basic transistor action.\n\n- The minority carrier concentrations are determined in each region of the transistor. The principal currents in the device are determined by the diffusion of these minority carriers.\n\n- The common-base current gain, which leads to the common-emitter current gain, is a function of three factors—emitter injection efficiency, base transport factor, and recombination factor. The emitter injection efficiency takes into account carriers from the base that are injected back into the emitter, the base transport factor takes into account recombination in the base region, and the recombination factor takes into account carriers that recombine within the forward-biased B–E junction.\n\n- Several nonideal effects are considered:\n  1. **Base width modulation, or Early effect**—the change in the neutral base width with a change in B–C voltage, producing a change in collector current with a change in B–C or C–E voltage.\n  2. **High-injection effects** that cause the collector current to increase at a slower rate with base–emitter voltage.\n  3. **Emitter bandgap narrowing** that produces a smaller emitter injection efficiency because of a very large emitter region doping concentration.\n  4. **Current crowding effects** that produce a larger current density at the emitter edge than in the center of the emitter.\n  5. A **nonuniform base doping concentration** that induces an electric field in the base region, which aids the flow of minority carriers across the base.\n  6. Two **breakdown voltage mechanisms**—punch-through and avalanche.\n\n- Three equivalent circuits or mathematical models of the transistor are considered. The Ebers–Moll model and equivalent circuit are applicable in any of the transistor operating modes. The Gummel–Poon model is convenient to use when nonuniform doping exists in the transistor. The small-signal hybrid-pi model applies to transistors operating in the forward-active mode in linear amplifier circuits.\n\n- The cutoff frequency of a transistor, a figure of merit for the transistor, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain becomes equal to unity. The frequency response is a function of the emitter–base junction capacitance charging time, the base transit time, the collector depletion region transit time, and the collector capacitance charging time.\n\n- The switching characteristics are closely related to the frequency limitations although switching involves large changes in currents and voltages. An important parameter in switching is the charge storage time, which applies to a transistor switching from saturation to cutoff.",

    "text": "## 8.1 | pn JUNCTION CURRENT\nWhen a forward-bias voltage is applied to a pn junction, a current will be induced in the device. We initially consider a qualitative discussion of how charges flow in the pn junction and then consider the mathematical derivation of the current—voltage relationship.\n\n### 8.1.1 Qualitative Description of Charge Flow in a pn Junction\nWe can qualitatively understand the mechanism of the current in a pn junction by again considering the energy-band diagrams. Figure 8.1a shows the energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium that was developed in the last chapter. We argued that the potential barrier seen by the electrons, for example, holds back the large concentration of electrons in the n region and keeps them from flowing into the p region. Similarly, the potential barrier seen by the holes holds back the large concentration of holes in the p region and keeps them from flowing into the n region. The potential barrier, then, maintains thermal equilibrium.\nFigure 8.1b shows the energy-band diagram of a reverse-biased pn junction. The potential of the n region is positive with respect to the p region so the Fermi energy in the n region is lower than that in the p region. The total potential barrier is now larger than that for the zero-bias case. We argued in the last chapter that the increased potential barrier continues to hold back the electrons and holes so that there is still essentially no charge flow and hence essentially no current.\n\nFigure 8.1c shows the energy-band diagram for the case when a positive voltage is applied to the p region with respect to the n region. The Fermi level in the p region is now lower than that in the n region. The total potential barrier is now reduced. The smaller potential barrier means that the electric field in the depletion region is also reduced. The smaller electric field means that the electrons and holes are no longer held back in the n and p regions, respectively. There will be a diffusion of holes from the p region across the space charge region where they will flow into the n region. Similarly, there will be a diffusion of electrons from the n region across the space charge region where they will flow into the p region. The flow of charge generates a current through the pn junction.\n\nThe injection of holes into the n region means that these holes are minority carriers. Likewise, the injection of electrons into the p region means that these electrons are minority carriers. The behavior of these minority carriers is described by the ambipolar transport equations that were discussed in Chapter 6. There will be diffusion as well as recombination of excess carriers in these regions. The diffusion of carriers implies that there will be diffusion currents. The mathematical derivation of the pn junction current–voltage relationship is considered in the next section.\n\nFigure 8.1: A pn junction and its associated energy-band diagram for (a) zero bias, (b) reverse bias, and (c) forward bias.\n\nThis figure illustrates the structure and energy band diagrams of a pn junction under three different biasing conditions:  \n(a) **Zero Bias**,  \n(b) **Reverse Bias**, and  \n(c) **Forward Bias**.\n\n(a) Zero Bias\n\n**Structure and Electric Field**\n- A p-type and an n-type semiconductor are joined to form a pn junction.\n- No external voltage is applied.\n- The built-in potential barrier, denoted as $eV_{bi}$, is established due to the diffusion of electrons and holes.\n- This diffusion leads to the formation of a **depletion region** of width $W$, where mobile charge carriers are depleted.\n- An internal electric field $\\vec{E}$ is set up from the n-side to the p-side due to ionized donor and acceptor atoms.\n\n**Energy Band Diagram**\n- The conduction band edge ($E_c$) and valence band edge ($E_v$) bend across the junction due to the built-in electric field.\n- The **Fermi level** is constant throughout the structure, indicating thermal equilibrium.\n- On the p-side, the Fermi level ($E_{Fp}$) is closer to the valence band, while on the n-side, the Fermi level ($E_{Fn}$) is closer to the conduction band.\n- The energy difference between $E_c$ and $E_v$ across the junction equals the built-in potential:  \n  $$ \\Delta E = eV_{bi} $$\n\n(b) Reverse Bias\n\n**Structure and Electric Field**\n- An external voltage $V_R$ is applied such that the p-side is connected to the negative terminal and the n-side to the positive terminal.\n- This increases the barrier potential to $e(V_{bi} + V_R)$.\n- The depletion width $W$ increases as a result, and the electric field across the junction becomes stronger.\n- Minority carrier injection is negligible, so the current flow is minimal (reverse saturation current).\n\n**Energy Band Diagram**\n- The energy bands bend more steeply across the junction due to the increased barrier.\n- The separation between the quasi-Fermi levels increases.\n- The barrier becomes harder for electrons and holes to surmount:\n  $$ \\Delta E = e(V_{bi} + V_R) $$\n\n\n(c) Forward Bias\n**Structure and Electric Field**\n- An external voltage $V_a$ is applied such that the p-side is connected to the positive terminal and the n-side to the negative terminal.\n- This reduces the built-in potential to $e(V_{bi} - V_a)$.\n- The depletion width $W$ narrows, and the internal electric field weakens.\n- Electrons from the n-side and holes from the p-side are injected into the opposite region, leading to significant current flow.\n\n**Energy Band Diagram**\n- The energy barrier is reduced, making it easier for carriers to diffuse across the junction.\n- Electrons flow from n to p, and holes flow from p to n.\n- The current is dominated by the diffusion of minority carriers.\n- The new effective barrier is:  \n  $$ \\Delta E = e(V_{bi} - V_a) $$\n\nSummary\n\n| Bias Condition | Depletion Width $W$ | Barrier Height | Current Flow |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Zero Bias      | Moderate             | $eV_{bi}$       | No net current |\n| Reverse Bias   | Increases            | $e(V_{bi} + V_R)$ | Negligible (reverse saturation) |\n| Forward Bias   | Decreases            | $e(V_{bi} - V_a)$ | Significant diffusion current |\n\nThese band diagrams are fundamental to understanding **charge carrier behavior**, **rectification**, and **current-voltage characteristics** in pn junction diodes.\n\n### 8.1.2 Ideal Current–Voltage Relationship\n\nThe ideal current–voltage relationship of a pn junction is derived on the basis of four assumptions. (The last assumption has three parts, but each part deals with current.) They are:\n\n1. **The abrupt depletion layer approximation applies.** The space charge regions have abrupt boundaries, and the semiconductor is neutral outside of the depletion region.\n\n2. **The Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation applies to carrier statistics.**\n\n3. **The concepts of low injection and complete ionization apply.**\n\n4. **The total current is a constant throughout the entire pn structure.**\n\n   4a. The total current is a constant throughout the entire pn structure.\n\n   4b. The individual electron and hole currents are continuous functions through the pn structure.\n\n   4c. The individual electron and hole currents are constant throughout the depletion region.\n\nNotation can sometimes appear to be overwhelming in the equations in this chapter. Table 8.1 lists some of the various electron and hole concentration terms that appear. Many terms have already been used in previous chapters but are repeated here for convenience.\n\n**Table 8.1** Commonly used terms and notation for this chapter\n\n| Term       | Meaning                                                                 |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \\( N_a \\)  | Acceptor concentration in the p region of the pn junction               |\n| \\( N_d \\)  | Donor concentration in the n region of the pn junction                  |\n| \\( n_{eo} = N_d \\) | Thermal-equilibrium majority carrier electron concentration in the n region |\n| \\( p_{eo} = N_a \\) | Thermal-equilibrium majority carrier hole concentration in the p region |\n| \\( n_{po} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_a} \\) | Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration in the p region |\n| \\( p_{no} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_d} \\) | Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier hole concentration in the n region |\n| \\( n_p \\)  | Total minority carrier electron concentration in the p region           |\n| \\( p_n \\)  | Total minority carrier hole concentration in the n region               |\n| \\( n_p(x) \\) | Minority carrier electron concentration in the p region at the space charge edge |\n| \\( p_n(x) \\) | Minority carrier hole concentration in the n region at the space charge edge |\n| \\( \\delta n_p = n_p - n_{po} \\) | Excess minority carrier electron concentration in the p region |\n| \\( \\delta p_n = p_n - p_{no} \\) | Excess minority carrier hole concentration in the n region |\n\n- **$N_a$** is the acceptor concentration in the p region of the pn junction.\n\n- **$N_d$** is the donor concentration in the n region of the pn junction.\n\n- **$n_0 = N_d$** is the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier electron concentration in the n region.\n\n- **$p_0 = N_a$** is the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier hole concentration in the p region.\n\n- **$n_{p0} = \\dfrac{n_i^2}{N_a}$** is the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration in the p region.\n\n- **$p_{n0} = \\dfrac{n_i^2}{N_d}$** is the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier hole concentration in the n region.\n\n- **$n_p$** is the total minority carrier electron concentration in the p region.\n\n- **$p_n$** is the total minority carrier hole concentration in the n region.\n\n- **$n_p(-x_p)$** is the minority carrier electron concentration in the p region at the space charge edge.\n\n- **$p_n(x_n)$** is the minority carrier hole concentration in the n region at the space charge edge.\n\n- **$\\delta n_p = n_p - n_{p0}$** is the excess minority carrier electron concentration in the p region.\n\n- **$\\delta p_n = p_n - p_{n0}$** is the excess minority carrier hole concentration in the n region.\n\n### 8.1.3 Boundary Conditions\n\nFigure 8.2 shows the conduction-band energy through the pn junction in thermal equilibrium. The n region contains many more electrons in the conduction band than the p region; the built-in potential barrier prevents this large density of electrons from flowing into the p region. The built-in potential barrier maintains equilibrium between the carrier distributions on either side of the junction.\n\nAn expression for the built-in potential barrier was derived in the last chapter and was given by Equation (7.10) as\n\n\\[\nV_{bi} = V_t \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Figure 8.2.1** Conduction-band energy through a pn junction.\n\nIf we divide the equation by \\( V_t = kT/e \\), take the exponential of both sides, and then take the reciprocal, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_i^2}{N_D N_A} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{eV_0}{kT}\\right) \\tag{8.1}\n\\]\n\nIf we assume complete ionization, we can write\n\n\\[\nn_{n0} \\approx N_D \\tag{8.2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n_{n0} \\) is the thermal-equilibrium concentration of majority carrier electrons in the n region. In the p region, we can write\n\n\\[\nn_{p0} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} \\tag{8.3}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n_{p0} \\) is the thermal-equilibrium concentration of minority carrier electrons. Substituting Equations (8.2) and (8.3) into Equation (8.1), we obtain\n\n\\[\nn_{p0} = n_{n0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{eV_0}{kT}\\right) \\tag{8.4}\n\\]\n\nThis equation relates the minority carrier electron concentration on the p side of the junction to the majority carrier electron concentration on the n side of the junction in thermal equilibrium.\n\nIf a positive voltage is applied to the p region with respect to the n region, the potential barrier is reduced. Figure 8.3a shows a pn junction with an applied voltage \\( V_a \\). The electric field in the bulk p and n regions is normally very small. Essentially all of the applied voltage is across the junction region. The electric field \\( E_{\\text{app}} \\) induced by the applied voltage is in the opposite direction to the thermal-equilibrium space charge electric field, so the net electric field in the space charge region is reduced below the equilibrium value. The delicate balance between diffusion and the E-field force achieved at thermal equilibrium is upset. The electric field force that prevented majority carriers from crossing the space charge region is reduced; majority carrier electrons from the n side are now injected across the depletion region into the p material, and majority carrier holes from the p side are injected across the depletion region into the n material. As long as the bias \\( V_a \\) is applied, the injection of carriers across the space charge region continues and a current is created in the pn junction. This bias condition is known as forward bias; the energy-band diagram of the forward-biased pn junction is shown in Figure 8.3b.\n\nFigure 8.3: (a) A pn junction with an applied forward-bias voltage showing the directions of the electric field induced by \\( V_a \\) and the space charge electric field. (b) Energy-band diagram of the forward-biased pn junction.\n\n(a) Forward-Biased pn Junction and Electric Field Components\n\n- A forward-bias voltage $V_a$ is applied: the p-side is connected to the positive terminal, and the n-side to the negative terminal.\n- The applied electric field $\\vec{E}_{\\text{app}}$ points from n to p, opposing the built-in field $\\vec{E}$ caused by the ionized donors and acceptors.\n- The **net electric field** across the depletion region is reduced due to this opposition, resulting in a **narrower depletion width** (denoted by $W_p$ and $W_n$ on each side).\n- As the total barrier is lowered, carrier injection becomes easier, leading to increased diffusion of electrons and holes.\n\n(b) Energy-Band Diagram of the Forward-Biased Junction\n\n- The conduction band edge ($E_c$) and valence band edge ($E_v$) exhibit reduced bending across the junction due to the reduced electric field.\n- The potential barrier is lowered from $eV_{bi}$ to $e(V_{bi} - V_a)$.\n- Two quasi-Fermi levels are introduced:  \n  - $E_{Fp}$ for holes on the p-side,  \n  - $E_{Fn}$ for electrons on the n-side.  \n  These indicate that the device is out of thermal equilibrium.\n- The separation between $E_{Fn}$ and $E_{Fp}$ across the junction represents the **applied voltage** $eV_a$:\n  $$ E_{Fn} - E_{Fp} = eV_a $$\n- This separation enables significant injection of majority carriers across the junction, resulting in **forward current flow**.\n\nThe potential barrier \\( V_0 \\) in Equation (8.4) can be replaced by \\( (V_0 - V_a) \\) when the junction is forward biased. Equation (8.4) becomes\n\n\\[\nn_p = n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-e(V_0 - V_a)}{kT} \\right) = n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-eV_0}{kT} \\right) \\exp \\left( \\frac{+eV_a}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.5)\n\nIf we assume low injection, the majority carrier electron concentration \\( n_{n0} \\), for example, does not change significantly. However, the minority carrier concentration, \\( n_p \\), can deviate from its thermal-equilibrium value \\( n_{p0} \\) by orders of magnitude. Using Equation (8.4), we can write Equation (8.5) as\n\n\\[\nn_p = n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.6)\n\nWhen a forward-bias voltage is applied to the pn junction, the junction is no longer in thermal equilibrium. The left side of Equation (8.6) is the total minority carrier electron concentration in the p region, which is now greater than the thermal equilibrium value. The forward-bias voltage lowers the potential barrier so that majority carrier electrons from the n region are injected across the junction into the p region, thereby increasing the minority carrier electron concentration. We have produced excess minority carrier electrons in the p region.\n\nWhen the electrons are injected into the p region, these excess carriers are subject to the diffusion and recombination processes we discussed in Chapter 6. Equation (8.6), then, is the expression for the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the space charge region in the p region.\n\nExactly the same process occurs for majority carrier holes in the p region, which are injected across the space charge region into the n region under a forward-bias voltage. We can write that\n\n\\[\np_n = p_{n0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.7)\n\nwhere \\( p_n \\) is the concentration of minority carrier holes at the edge of the space charge region in the n region. Figure 8.4 shows these results. By applying a forward-bias voltage, we create excess minority carriers in each region of the pn junction.\n\nFigure 8.4: Excess minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges generated by the forward-bias voltage.\n\nThis figure shows the excess minority carrier concentrations at the edges of the space charge region under forward bias.  \nHoles are injected from the p-side into the n-side, and electrons are injected from the n-side into the p-side.  \nAt $x = -x_p$, the minority electron concentration in the p-region is:  \n$$ n_p(-x_p) = n_{p0} \\exp\\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) $$  \nAt $x = x_n$, the minority hole concentration in the n-region is:  \n$$ p_n(x_n) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) $$  \nThis exponential increase reflects the injection efficiency of carriers due to the applied forward-bias voltage $V_a$.\n\nThe minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges, given by Equations (8.6) and (8.7), were derived assuming that a forward-bias voltage (\\( V_a > 0 \\)) was applied across the pn junction. However, nothing in the derivation prevents \\( V_a \\) from being negative (reverse bias). If a reverse-biased voltage greater than a few tenths of a volt is applied to the pn junction, then we see from Equations (8.6) and (8.7) that the minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edge are essentially zero. The minority carrier concentrations for the reverse-biased condition drop below the thermal-equilibrium values.\n\n### 8.1.4 Minority Carrier Distribution\n\nWe developed, in Chapter 6, the ambipolar transport equation for excess minority carrier holes in an n region. This equation, in one dimension, is\n\n\\[\nD_p \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta p_n)}{\\partial x^2} - \\mu_p E \\frac{\\partial (\\delta p_n)}{\\partial x} + g' - \\frac{\\delta p_n}{\\tau_{p0}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta p_n)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(8.8)\n\nwhere \\( \\delta p_n = p_n - p_{n0} \\) is the excess minority carrier hole concentration and is the difference between the total and thermal equilibrium minority carrier concentrations. The ambipolar transport equation describes the behavior of excess carriers as a function of time and spatial coordinates.\n\nIn Chapter 5, we calculated drift current densities in a semiconductor. We determined that relatively large currents could be created with fairly small electric fields. As a first approximation, we assume that the electric field is zero in both the neutral p and n regions. In the n region for \\( x > x_n \\), we have that \\( E = 0 \\) and \\( g' = 0 \\). If we also assume steady state so \\( \\partial (\\delta p_n)/\\partial t = 0 \\), then Equation (8.8) reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 (\\delta p_n)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n}{L_{p}^2} = 0 \\quad (x > x_n)\n\\]\n\n(8.9)\n\nwhere \\( L_{p}^2 = D_p \\tau_{p0} \\). For the same set of conditions, the excess minority carrier electron concentration in the p region is determined from\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 (\\delta n_p)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p}{L_{n}^2} = 0 \\quad (x < x_p)\n\\]\n\n(8.10)\n\nwhere \\( L_{n}^2 = D_n \\tau_{n0} \\).\n\n\nThe boundary conditions for the total minority carrier concentrations are\n\n\\[\np_n(x_n) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{kT}\\right) \\tag{8.11a}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn_p(-x_p) = n_{p0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{kT}\\right) \\tag{8.11b}\n\\]\n\n\\[\np_n(x \\to +\\infty) = p_{n0} \\tag{8.11c}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn_p(x \\to -\\infty) = n_{p0} \\tag{8.11d}\n\\]\n\nAs minority carriers diffuse from the space charge edge into the neutral semiconductor regions, they recombine with majority carriers. We assume that the lengths \\(W_n\\) and \\(W_p\\) shown in Figure 8.3a are very long, meaning in particular that \\(W_n \\gg L_n\\) and \\(W_p \\gg L_p\\). The excess minority carrier concentrations must approach zero at distances far from the space charge region. The structure is referred to as a long pn junction.\n\nThe general solution to Equation (8.9) is\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_n(x) = p_n(x) - p_{n0} = A e^{+x/L_p} + B e^{-x/L_p} \\quad (x \\geq x_n) \\tag{8.12}\n\\]\n\nand the general solution to Equation (8.10) is\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_p(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0} = C e^{+x/L_n} + D e^{-x/L_n} \\quad (x \\leq -x_p) \\tag{8.13}\n\\]\n\nApplying the boundary conditions from Equations (8.11c) and (8.11d), the coefficients \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) must be zero. The coefficients \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) may be determined from the boundary conditions given by Equations (8.11a) and (8.11b). The excess carrier concentrations are then found to be, for \\(x \\geq x_n\\),\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_n(x) = p_n(x) - p_{n0} = p_{n0} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{kT}\\right) - 1\\right] \\exp\\left(\\frac{x - x_n}{L_p}\\right) \\tag{8.14}\n\\]\n\nand, for \\(x \\leq -x_p\\),\n\n\\[\n\\delta n_p(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0} = n_{p0} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{kT}\\right) - 1\\right] \\exp\\left(\\frac{x + x_p}{L_n}\\right) \\tag{8.15}\n\\]\n\nThe minority carrier concentrations decay exponentially with distance away from the junction to their thermal-equilibrium values. Figure 8.5 shows these results. Again, we have assumed that both the n-region and the p-region lengths are long compared to the minority carrier diffusion lengths.\n\nIn Chapter 6, we discussed the concept of quasi-Fermi levels, which apply to excess carriers in a nonequilibrium condition. Since excess electrons exist in the neutral p region and excess holes exist in the neutral n region, we can apply quasi-Fermi levels to these regions. We had defined quasi-Fermi levels in terms of carrier concentrations as\n\n\\[\np = p_0 + \\delta p = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fi} - E_{Fp}}{kT}\\right) \\tag{8.16}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nn = n_0 + \\delta n = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn} - E_{Fi}}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.17)\n\nFigure 8.6 shows the quasi-Fermi levels through the pn junction. From Equations (8.14) and (8.15), the carrier concentrations are exponential functions of distance, and from Equations (8.16) and (8.17), the carrier concentrations are exponential functions of the quasi-Fermi levels. The quasi-Fermi levels are then linear functions of distance in the neutral p and n regions as shown in Figure 8.6.\n\nWe may note that close to the space charge edge in the p region, \\(E_{Fn} - E_{Fi} > 0\\) which means that \\(\\delta n > n_i\\). Further from the space charge edge, \\(E_{Fn} - E_{Fi} < 0\\) which means that \\(\\delta n < n_i\\) and the excess electron concentration is approaching zero. The same discussion applies to the excess hole concentration in the n region.\n\nAt the space charge edge at \\(x = x_n\\), we can write, for low injection\n\n\\[\nn_e p_e (x_n) = n_e p_{e0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_a}{V_t}\\right) = n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_a}{V_t}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.18)\n\nCombining Equations (8.16) and (8.17), we can write\n\n\\[\nnp = n_i^2 \\exp \\left( \\frac{E_{Fn} - E_{Fp}}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.19)\n\nComparing Equations (8.18) and (8.19), the difference in quasi-Fermi levels is related to the applied bias \\( V_a \\) and represents the deviation from thermal equilibrium. The difference between \\( E_{Fn} \\) and \\( E_{Fp} \\) is nearly constant through the depletion region.\n\nTo review, a forward-bias voltage lowers the built-in potential barrier of a pn junction so that electrons from the n region are injected across the space charge region, creating excess minority carriers in the p region. These excess electrons begin diffusing into the bulk p region where they can recombine with majority carrier holes. The excess minority carrier electron concentration then decreases with distance from the junction. The same discussion applies to holes injected across the space charge region into the n region.\n\nFigure 8.5: Steady-state minority carrier concentrations in a pn junction under forward bias.\n\nThis figure shows the steady-state distribution of minority carriers in a pn junction under forward bias.  \nExcess electrons accumulate in the p-region, and excess holes accumulate in the n-region due to carrier injection.  \nThe minority carrier concentrations $n_p(x)$ and $p_n(x)$ decay exponentially away from the depletion region.  \nAt the depletion edges ($x = -x_p$ and $x = x_n$), carrier concentrations match the values set by the injection condition.  \nFar from the junction, the concentrations approach their equilibrium values $n_{p0}$ and $p_{n0}$.\n\nFigure 8.6: Quasi-Fermi levels through a forward-biased pn junction.\n\nThis figure illustrates the separation of quasi-Fermi levels in a forward-biased pn junction.  \n$E_{Fn}$ and $E_{Fp}$ represent the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels, respectively.  \nThe separation between $E_{Fn}$ and $E_{Fp}$ reflects the applied voltage:  \n$$ E_{Fn} - E_{Fp} = eV_a $$  \nThis non-equilibrium condition leads to injection and diffusion of carriers across the junction.\n\n### 8.1.5 Ideal pn Junction Current\n\nThe approach we use to determine the current in a pn junction is based on the three parts of the fourth assumption stated earlier in this section. The total current in the junction is the sum of the individual electron and hole currents that are constant through the depletion region. Since the electron and hole currents are continuous functions through the pn junction, the total pn junction current will be the minority carrier hole diffusion current at \\( x = x_n \\) plus the minority carrier electron diffusion current at \\( x = -x_p \\). The gradients in the minority carrier concentrations, as shown in Figure 8.5, produce diffusion currents, and since we are assuming the electric field to be zero at the space charge edges, we can neglect any minority carrier drift current component. This approach in determining the pn junction current is shown in Figure 8.7.\n\nWe can calculate the minority carrier hole diffusion current density at \\( x = x_n \\) from the relation\n\n\\[\nJ_p(x_n) = -eD_p \\left. \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} \\right|_{x=x_n}\n\\]\n\n(8.20)\n\nSince we are assuming uniformly doped regions, the thermal-equilibrium carrier concentration is constant, so the hole diffusion current density may be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_p(x_n) = -eD_p \\left. \\frac{d\\Delta p(x)}{dx} \\right|_{x=x_n}\n\\]\n\n(8.21)\n\nTaking the derivative of Equation (8.14) and substituting into Equation (8.21), we obtain\n\n\\[\nJ_p(x_n) = \\frac{eD_p n_{p0}}{L_p} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.22)\n\nThe hole current density for this forward-bias condition is in the \\( +x \\) direction, which is from the p to the n region.\n\nSimilarly, we may calculate the electron diffusion current density at \\( x = -x_p \\). This may be written as\n\n\\[\nJ_n(-x_p) = eD_n \\left. \\frac{d\\Delta n(x)}{dx} \\right|_{x=-x_p}\n\\]\n\n(8.23)\n\nUsing Equation (8.15), we obtain\n\n\\[\nJ_n(-x_p) = \\frac{eD_n n_{p0}}{L_n} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.24)\n\nThe electron current density is also in the \\( +x \\) direction.\n\nAn assumption we made at the beginning was that the individual electron and hole currents were continuous functions and constant through the space charge region. The total current is the sum of the electron and hole currents and is constant through the entire junction. Figure 8.7 again shows a plot of the magnitudes of these currents.\n\nThe total current density in the pn junction is then\n\n\\[\nJ = J_p(x_n) + J_n(-x_p) = \\left[ \\frac{eD_p n_{p0}}{L_p} + \\frac{eD_n n_{p0}}{L_n} \\right] \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.25)\n\nEquation (8.25) is the ideal current–voltage relationship of a pn junction.\n\nWe may define a parameter \\( J_s \\) as\n\n\\[\nJ_s = \\frac{eD_p n_{p0}}{L_p} + \\frac{eD_n n_{p0}}{L_n}\n\\]\n\n(8.26)\n\nso that Equation (8.25) may be written as\n\n\\[\nJ = J_s \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.27)\n\nEquation (8.27), known as the ideal-diode equation, gives a good description of the current–voltage characteristics of the pn junction over a wide range of currents and voltages. Although Equation (8.27) was derived assuming a forward-bias voltage (\\( V_a > 0 \\)), there is nothing to prevent \\( V_a \\) from being negative (reverse bias). Equation (8.27) is plotted in Figure 8.8 as a function of forward-bias voltage \\( V_a \\). If the voltage \\( V_a \\) becomes negative (reverse bias) by a few kT/eV, then the reverse-biased current density becomes independent of the reverse-biased voltage. The parameter \\( J_s \\) is then referred to as the reverse-saturation current density. The current–voltage characteristics of the pn junction diode are obviously not bilateral.\n\nFigure 8.7: Electron and hole current densities through the space charge region of a pn junction.\n\nThis figure shows the individual contributions of electron and hole current densities in the space charge region under forward bias.  \n$J_n(-x_p)$ is the electron diffusion current entering the p-side, and $J_p(x_n)$ is the hole diffusion current entering the n-side.  \nThese two diffusion components are the dominant current mechanisms in the quasi-neutral regions.  \nThe total current density is constant and given by:  \n$$ J_{\\text{Total}} = J_p(x_n) + J_n(-x_p) $$  \nThis reflects steady-state operation where net current is continuous across the junction.\n\nFigure 8.8: Ideal \\( I \\text{-} V \\) characteristic of a pn junction diode.\n\nThis figure shows the ideal current–voltage ($I$–$V$) characteristic of a pn junction diode.  \nUnder forward bias ($V_a > 0$), the current density $J$ increases exponentially with voltage.  \nUnder reverse bias ($V_a < 0$), the current saturates at a small constant value $-J_s$, called the reverse saturation current.  \nThe behavior follows the ideal diode equation:  \n$$ J = J_s \\left( e^{\\frac{eV_a}{kT}} - 1 \\right) $$  \nThis curve captures the rectifying nature of the pn junction.\n\n\\((\\mu \\text{m}/y = 0.1 \\, \\text{X} \\, 0^{\\circ} \\text{C} \\, \\text{E} = f' \\, \\text{SUY})\\)\n\nIf the forward-bias voltage in Equation (8.27) is positive by more than a few \\( kT/eV \\), then the \\((-1)\\) term in Equation (8.27) becomes negligible. Figure 8.9 shows the forward-bias current–voltage characteristic when the current is plotted on a log scale. Ideally, this plot yields a straight line when \\( V_a \\) is greater than a few \\( kT/eV \\). The forward-bias current is an exponential function of the forward-bias voltage.\n\n\n**Figure 8.9** | Ideal \\( I-V \\) characteristic of a pn junction diode with the current plotted on a log scale.\n\n### 8.1.6 Summary of Physics\n\nWe have been considering the case of a forward-bias voltage being applied to a pn junction. The forward-bias voltage lowers the potential barrier so that electrons and holes are injected across the space charge region. The injected carriers become minority carriers which then diffuse from the junction and recombine with majority carriers.\n\nWe calculated the minority carrier diffusion current densities at the edge of the space charge region. We can reconsider Equations (8.14) and (8.15) and determine...\n\n**Figure 8.10** Ideal electron and hole current components through a pn junction under forward bias.\n\nThe minority carrier diffusion current densities as a function of distance through the p and n regions. These results are\n\n\\[\nJ_{p}(x) = \\frac{eD_{p}n_{0}}{L_{p}} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{a}}{kT}\\right) - 1 \\right] \\exp\\left(\\frac{x_{n} - x}{L_{p}}\\right) \\quad (x \\geq x_{n})\n\\]\n\n(8.28)\n\nand\n\n\\[\nJ_{n}(x) = \\frac{eD_{n}p_{0}}{L_{n}} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{a}}{kT}\\right) - 1 \\right] \\exp\\left(\\frac{x_{p} + x}{L_{n}}\\right) \\quad (x \\leq -x_{p})\n\\]\n\n(8.29)\n\nThe minority carrier diffusion current densities decay exponentially in each region. However, the total current through the pn junction is constant. The difference between total current and minority carrier diffusion current is a majority carrier current. Figure 8.10 shows the various current components through the pn structure. The drift of majority carrier holes in the p region far from the junction, for example, is to supply holes that are being injected across the space charge region into the n region and also to supply holes that are lost by recombination with excess minority carrier electrons. The same discussion applies to the drift of electrons in the n region.\n\nWe have seen that excess carriers are created in a forward-biased pn junction. From the results of the ambipolar transport theory derived in Chapter 6, the behavior of the excess carriers is determined by the minority carrier parameters for low injection. In determining the current–voltage relationship of the pn junction, we consider the flow of minority carriers since we know the behavior and characteristics of these particles. It may seem strange, at times, that we concern ourselves so much with minority carriers rather than with the vast number of majority carriers, but the reason for this can be found in the results derived from the ambipolar transport theory.\n\nThe fact that we now have drift current densities in the p and n regions implies that the electric field in these regions is not zero as we had originally assumed. We can calculate the electric field in the neutral regions and determine the validity of our zero-field approximation.\n\n### 8.1.7 Temperature Effects\n\nThe ideal reverse-saturation current density \\( J_s \\), given by Equation (8.26), is a function of the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentrations \\( n_{p0} \\) and \\( p_{n0} \\). These minority carrier concentrations are proportional to \\( n_i^2 \\), which is a very strong function of temperature. For a silicon pn junction, the ideal reverse-saturation current density will increase by approximately a factor of 4 for every \\( 10^\\circ \\text{C} \\) increase in temperature.\nThe forward-bias current–voltage relation is given by Equation (8.27). This relation includes \\( J_s \\) as well as the \\(\\exp(eV/kT)\\) factor, making the forward-bias current–voltage relation a function of temperature also. As temperature increases, less forward-bias voltage is required to obtain the same diode current. If the voltage is held constant, the diode current will increase as temperature increases. The change in forward-bias current with temperature is less sensitive than the reverse-saturation current.\n\n### 8.1.8 The “Short” Diode\n\nWe assumed in the previous analysis that both p and n regions were long compared with the minority carrier diffusion lengths. In many pn junction structures, one region may, in fact, be short compared with the minority carrier diffusion length. Figure 8.11 shows one such example: the length \\( W_n \\) is assumed to be much smaller than the minority carrier hole diffusion length, \\( L_p \\).\n\n!Geometry of a \"short\" diode.\n\nThe steady-state excess minority carrier hole concentration in the n region is determined from Equation (8.9), which is given as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 (\\delta p_n)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n}{L_p^2} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe original boundary condition at \\( x = x_n \\) still applies, given by Equation (8.11a) as\n\n\\[\np_n(x_n) = p_{n0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\nA second boundary condition needs to be determined. In many cases we assume that an ohmic contact exists at \\( x = (x_n + W_n) \\), implying an infinite surface-recombination velocity and therefore an excess minority carrier concentration of zero. The second boundary condition is then written as\n\n\\[\np_n(x = x_n + W_n) = p_{n0} \\tag{8.30}\n\\]\n\nThe general solution to Equation (8.9) is again given by Equation (8.12), which was\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_n (x) = p_n(x) - p_{n0} = A e^{x/L_p} + B e^{-x/L_p} \\quad (x \\geq x_n)\n\\]\n\nIn this case, because of the finite length of the n region, both terms of the general solution must be retained. Applying the boundary conditions of Equations (8.11b) and (8.30), the excess minority carrier concentration is given by\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_n(x) = p_{n0} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] \\frac{\\sinh \\left[ (x_n + W_n - x)/L_p \\right]}{\\sinh[W_n/L_p]} \\tag{8.31}\n\\]\n\nEquation (8.31) is the general solution for the excess minority carrier hole concentration in the n region of a forward-biased pn junction. If \\( W_n \\gg L_p \\), the assumption for the long diode, Equation (8.31) reduces to the previous result given by Equation (8.14). If \\( W_n \\ll L_p \\), we can approximate the hyperbolic sine terms by\n\n\\[\n\\sinh \\left[ \\frac{x_n + W_n - x}{L_p} \\right] \\approx \\frac{x_n + W_n - x}{L_p} \\tag{8.32a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\sinh \\left[ \\frac{W_n}{L_p} \\right] \\approx \\frac{W_n}{L_p} \\tag{8.32b}\n\\]\n\nThen Equation (8.31) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_n(x) = p_{n0} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right] \\frac{x_n + W_n - x}{W_n} \\tag{8.33}\n\\]\nThe minority carrier concentration becomes a linear function of distance. The minority carrier hole diffusion current density is given by\n\n\\[\nJ_p = -eD_p \\frac{d\\Delta p(x)}{dx}\n\\]\n\nso that in the short n region, we have\n\n\\[\nJ_p(x) = \\frac{eD_p \\Delta p_0}{W_n} \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_A}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.34)\n\nThe minority carrier hole diffusion current density now contains the length \\( W_n \\) in the denominator, rather than the diffusion length \\( L_p \\). The diffusion current density is larger for a short diode than for a long diode since \\( W_n \\ll L_p \\). In addition, since the minority carrier concentration is approximately a linear function of distance through the n region, the minority carrier diffusion current density is a constant. This constant current implies that there is no recombination of minority carriers in the short region.",

Accordingly, within the space charge region, \\( n \\approx p \\approx 0 \\). The recombination rate from Equation (8.35) becomes\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{-C_n C_p N_t n_i^2}{C_n n' + C_p p'}\n\\]\n\n(8.36)\n\nThe negative sign implies a negative recombination rate; hence, we are really generating electron–hole pairs within the reverse-biased space charge region. The recombination of excess electrons and holes is the process whereby we are trying to reestablish thermal equilibrium. Since the concentration of electrons and holes is essentially zero within the reverse-biased space charge region, electrons and holes are being generated via the trap level to also try to reestablish thermal equilibrium. This generation process is schematically shown in Figure 8.12. As the electrons and holes are generated, they are swept out of the space charge region by the electric field. The flow of charge is in the direction of a reverse-biased current. This **reverse-biased generation current**, caused by the generation of electrons and holes in the space charge region, is in addition to the ideal reverse-biased saturation current.\n\n\n**Figure 8.12** | Generation process in a reverse-biased pn junction.\n\nWe may calculate the density of the reverse-biased generation current by considering Equation (8.36). If we make a simplifying assumption and let the trap level be at the intrinsic Fermi level, then from Equations (6.92) and (6.97), we have that \\( n' = n_i \\) and \\( p' = n_i \\). Equation (8.36) now becomes\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{-n_i}{1 + \\frac{1}{N_C \\tau_p} + \\frac{1}{N_V \\tau_n}}\n\\]\n\n(8.37)\n\nUsing the definitions of lifetimes from Equations (6.103) and (6.104), we may write Equation (8.37) as\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{-n_i}{\\tau_{p0} + \\tau_{n0}}\n\\]\n\n(8.38)\n\nIf we define a new lifetime as the average of \\( \\tau_{p0} \\) and \\( \\tau_{n0} \\), or\n\n\\[\n\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\tau_{p0} + \\tau_{n0}}{2}\n\\]\n\n(8.39)\n\nthen the recombination rate can be written as\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{-n_i}{2\\tau_0} = -G\n\\]\n\n(8.40)\n\nThe negative recombination rate implies a generation rate, so \\( G \\) is the generation rate of electrons and holes in the space charge region.\n\nThe generation current density may be determined from\n\n\\[\nJ_{gen} = \\int_0^W eG \\, dx\n\\]\n\n(8.41)\n\nwhere the integral is over the space charge region. If we assume that the generation rate is constant throughout the space charge region, then we obtain\n\n\\[\nJ_{gen} = \\frac{en_i W}{2\\tau_0}\n\\]\n\n(8.42)\n\nThe total reverse-biased current density is the sum of the ideal reverse saturation current density and the generation current density, or\n\n\\[\nJ_r = J_s + J_{gen}\n\\]\n\n(8.43)\n\nThe ideal reverse-saturation current density \\( J_s \\) is independent of the reverse-biased voltage. However, \\( J_{gen} \\) is a function of the depletion width \\( W \\), which in turn is a function of the reverse-biased voltage. The actual reverse-biased current density, then, is no longer independent of the reverse-biased voltage.\n\n**Forward-Bias Recombination Current**\n\nFor the reverse-biased pn junction, electrons and holes are essentially completely swept out of the space charge region so that \\( n = p \\approx 0 \\). Under forward bias, however, electrons and holes are injected across the space charge region, so we do, in fact, have some excess carriers in the space charge region. The possibility exists that some of these electrons and holes will recombine within the space charge region and not become part of the minority carrier distribution.\n\nThe recombination rate of electrons and holes is again given from Equation (8.35) as\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{C_n C_p N_i (np - n_i^2)}{C_n (n + n') + C_p (p + p')}\n\\]\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by \\( C_n C_p N_i \\) and using the definitions of \\( \\tau_{n0} \\) and \\( \\tau_{p0} \\), we may write the recombination rate as\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{np - n_i^2}{\\tau_{p0} (n + n') + \\tau_{n0} (p + p')} \\tag{8.44}\n\\]\n\nFigure 8.13 shows the energy-band diagram of the forward-biased pn junction. Shown in the figure are the intrinsic Fermi level and the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons and holes. From the results of Chapter 6, we may write the electron concentration as\n\n\\[\nn = n_i \\exp \\left[ \\frac{E_{Fn} - E_{Fi}}{kT} \\right] \\tag{8.45}\n\\]\n\nand the hole concentration as\n\n\\[\np = n_i \\exp \\left[ \\frac{E_{Fi} - E_{Fp}}{kT} \\right] \\tag{8.46}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( E_{Fn} \\) and \\( E_{Fp} \\) are the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons and holes, respectively.\n\n**Figure 8.13** | Energy-band diagram of a forward-biased pn junction including quasi-Fermi levels.\n\n**Figure 8.14** Relative magnitude of the recombination rate through the space charge region of a forward-biased pn junction.\n\nFrom Figure 8.13, we may note that\n\n\\[\n(E_{Fn} - E_{Fi}) + (E_{Fp} - E_{Fi}) = eV_a\n\\]\n\n(8.47)\n\nwhere \\( V_a \\) is the applied forward-bias voltage. Again, if we assume that the trap level is at the intrinsic Fermi level, then \\( n' = p' = n_i \\). Figure 8.14 shows a plot of the relative magnitude of the recombination rate as a function of distance through the space charge region. This plot was generated using Equations (8.44), (8.45), (8.46), and (8.47). A very sharp peak occurs at the metallurgical junction (\\( x = 0 \\)).\n\nAt the center of the space charge region, we have\n\n\\[\nE_{Fn} - E_{Fi} = E_{Fi} - E_{Fp} = \\frac{eV_a}{2}\n\\]\n\n(8.48)\n\nEquations (8.45) and (8.46) then become\n\n\\[\nn = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{2kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.49)\n\nand\n\n\\[\np = n_i \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{2kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.50)\n\nIf we assume that \\( n' = p' = n_i \\) and that \\( \\tau_{n0} = \\tau_{p0} = \\tau_0 \\), then Equation (8.44) becomes\n\n\\[\nR_{max} = \\frac{n_i}{2\\tau_0} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(eV_a/kT) - 1}{\\exp(eV_a/2kT) + 1} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.51)\n\nwhich is the maximum recombination rate for electrons and holes that occurs at the center of the forward-biased pn junction. If we assume that \\( V_a \\gg kT/e \\), we may neglect the \\((-1)\\) term in the numerator and the \\((+1)\\) term in the denominator. Equation (8.51) then becomes\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{n_i}{2\\tau_0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.52)\n\nThe recombination current density may be calculated from\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{rec}} = \\int_0^W eR \\, dx\n\\]\n\n(8.53)\n\nwhere again the integral is over the entire space charge region. In this case, however, the recombination rate is not a constant through the space charge region. We have calculated the maximum recombination rate at the center of the space charge region, so we may write\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{rec}} = ex' \\frac{n_i}{2\\tau_0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.54)\n\nwhere \\(x'\\) is a length over which the maximum recombination rate is effective. However, since \\(\\tau_0\\) may not be a well-defined or known parameter, it is customary to write\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{eWn_i}{2\\tau_0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\\right) = J_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{2kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.55)\n\nwhere \\(W\\) is the space charge width.\n\n**Total Forward-Bias Current**\nThe total forward-bias current density in the pn junction is the sum of the recombination and the ideal diffusion current densities. Figure 8.15 shows a plot of the minority carrier hole concentration in the neutral n region. This distribution yields the ideal hole diffusion current density and is a function of the minority carrier hole diffusion length and the applied junction voltage. The distribution is established as a result of holes being injected across the space charge region. If, now, some of the injected holes in the space charge region are lost due to recombination, then additional holes must be injected from the p region to make up for this loss. The flow of these additional injected carriers, per unit time, results in the recombination current. This added component is schematically shown in the figure.\n\n**Figure 8.15** Because of recombination, additional holes from the p region must be injected into the space charge region to establish the minority carrier hole concentration in the n region.\n\nThe total forward-bias current density is the sum of the recombination and the ideal diffusion current densities, so we can write\n\n\\[\nJ = J_{\\text{rec}} + J_D\n\\]\n\n(8.56)\n\nwhere \\( J_{\\text{rec}} \\) is given by Equation (8.55) and \\( J_D \\) is given by\n\n\\[\nJ_D = J_s \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.57)\n\nThe (−1) term in Equation (8.27) has been neglected. The parameter \\( J_s \\) is the ideal reverse-saturation current density, and from previous discussion, the value of \\( J_{a} \\) from the recombination current is larger than the value of \\( J_s \\).\n\nIf we take the natural log of Equations (8.55) and (8.57), we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\ln J_{\\text{rec}} = \\ln J_{a} + \\frac{eV_a}{2kT} = \\ln J_{a} + \\frac{V_a}{2V_t}\n\\]\n\n(8.58a)\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\ln J_D = \\ln J_s + \\frac{eV_a}{kT} = \\ln J_s + \\frac{V_a}{V_t}\n\\]\n\n(8.58b)\n\nFigure 8.16 shows the recombination and diffusion current components plotted on a log current scale as a function of \\( V_a/V_t \\). The slopes of the two curves are not the same. Also shown in the figure is the total current density—the sum of the two current components. We may notice that, at a low current density, the recombination current dominates, and at a higher current density, the ideal diffusion current dominates.\n\nIn general, the diode current–voltage relationship may be written as\n\n\\[\nI = I_s \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{nkT}\\right) - 1\\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.59)\n\nwhere the parameter \\( n \\) is called the **ideality factor**. For a large forward-bias voltage, \\( n \\approx 1 \\) when diffusion dominates, and for low forward-bias voltage, \\( n \\approx 2 \\) when recombination dominates. There is a transition region where \\( 1 < n < 2 \\).\n\n### 8.2.2 High-Level Injection\n\nIn the derivation of the ideal diode \\( I-V \\) relationship, we assumed that low injection was valid. Low injection implies that the excess minority carrier concentrations are always much less than the majority carrier concentration.\n\n**Figure 8.16** Ideal diffusion, recombination, and total current in a forward-biased pn junction.\n\nHowever, as the forward-bias voltage increases, the excess carrier concentrations increase and may become comparable or even greater than the majority carrier concentration. From Equation (8.18), we can write\n\n\\[\nnp = n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_a}{V_t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWe have that \\( n = n_0 + \\delta n \\) and \\( p = p_0 + \\delta p \\), so that\n\n\\[\n(n_0 + \\delta n)(p_0 + \\delta p) = n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_a}{V_t}\\right) \\tag{8.60}\n\\]\n\nUnder high-level injection, we may have \\( \\delta n > n_0 \\) and \\( \\delta p > p_0 \\) so that Equation (8.60) becomes approximately\n\n\\[\n(\\delta n)(\\delta p) \\approx n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_a}{V_t}\\right) \\tag{8.61}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\delta n = \\delta p \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\delta n = \\delta p \\approx n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_a}{2V_t}\\right) \\tag{8.62}\n\\]\n\nThe diode current is proportional to the excess carrier concentration so that, under high-level injection, we have\n\n\\[\nI \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_a}{2V_t}\\right) \\tag{8.63}\n\\]\n\n**Figure 8.17** | Forward-bias current versus voltage from low forward bias to high forward bias.\n\nIn the high-level injection region, it takes a larger increase in diode voltage to produce a given increase in diode current.\n\nThe diode forward-bias current, from low-bias levels to high-bias levels, is plotted in Figure 8.17. This plot shows the effect of recombination at low-bias voltages and high-level injection at high-bias voltages.",

    "text": "## 8.3 | SMALL-SIGNAL MODEL OF THE pn JUNCTION\n\nWe have been considering the dc characteristics of the pn junction diode. When semiconductor devices with pn junctions are used in linear amplifier circuits, for example, sinusoidal signals are superimposed on the dc currents and voltages, so that the small-signal characteristics of the pn junction become important.\n\n### 8.3.1 Diffusion Resistance\n\nThe ideal current–voltage relationship of the pn junction diode was given by Equation (8.27), where \\( J \\) and \\( J_s \\) are current densities. If we multiply both sides of the equation by the junction cross-sectional area, we have\n\n\\[\nI_D = I_s \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.64)\n\nwhere \\( I_D \\) is the diode current and \\( I_s \\) is the diode reverse-saturation current.\n\nAssume that the diode is forward-biased with a dc voltage \\( V_0 \\) producing a dc diode current \\( I_{DQ} \\). If we now superimpose a small, low-frequency sinusoidal voltage as shown in Figure 8.18, then a small sinusoidal current will be produced, superimposed on the dc current. The ratio of sinusoidal current to sinusoidal voltage is called the incremental conductance. In the limit of a very small sinusoidal current and voltage, the small-signal incremental conductance is just the slope of the dc current–voltage curve, or\n\n\\[\ng_d = \\left. \\frac{dI_D}{dV_a} \\right|_{I_D=I_{DQ}}\n\\]\n\n(8.65)\n\nThe reciprocal of the incremental conductance is the incremental resistance, defined as\n\n\\[\nr_d = \\left. \\frac{dV_a}{dI_D} \\right|_{I_D=I_{DQ}}\n\\]\n\n(8.66)\n\nwhere \\( I_{DQ} \\) is the dc quiescent diode current.\n\n\n**Figure 8.18** Curve showing the concept of the small-signal diffusion resistance.\n\n\nIf we assume that the diode is biased sufficiently far in the forward-bias region, then the \\((-1)\\) term can be neglected and the incremental conductance becomes\n\n\\[\ng_d = \\frac{dI}{dV} \\bigg|_{V=V_o} = \\left( \\frac{e}{kT} \\right) I_o \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_o}{kT} \\right) \\approx \\frac{I_{DQ}}{V_T}\n\\]\n\n(8.67)\n\nThe small-signal incremental resistance is then the reciprocal function, or\n\n\\[\nr_d = \\frac{V_T}{I_{DQ}}\n\\]\n\n(8.68)\n\nThe incremental resistance decreases as the bias current increases, and is inversely proportional to the slope of the \\(I-V\\) characteristic as shown in Figure 8.18. The incremental resistance is also known as the **diffusion resistance**.\n\n### 8.3.2 Small-Signal Admittance\n\nIn the last chapter, we considered the pn junction capacitance as a function of the reverse-biased voltage. When the pn junction diode is forward-biased, another capacitance becomes a factor in the diode admittance. The small-signal admittance, or impedance, of the pn junction under forward bias is derived using the minority carrier diffusion current relations we have already considered.\n\n**Qualitative Analysis** Before we delve into the mathematical analysis, we can qualitatively understand the physical processes that lead to a diffusion capacitance, which is one component of the junction admittance. Figure 8.19a schematically shows a pn junction forward biased with a dc voltage. A small ac voltage is also superimposed on the dc voltage so that the total forward-biased voltage can be written as \\( V_a = V_{dc} + v(t) \\) on set.\n\n**Figure 8.19** (a) A pn junction with an ac voltage superimposed on a forward-biased dc value; (b) the hole concentration versus time at the space charge edge; (c) the hole concentration versus distance in the n region at three different times.\n\n- **(a)** Schematic of pn junction with ac voltage.\n- **(b)** Hole concentration vs. time.\n- **(c)** Hole concentration vs. distance.\n\n- \\(V_{ac} = \\Phi \\sin \\omega t\\)\n- \\(p_{n0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{ac} + \\Phi}{V_T} \\right)\\)\n- \\(p_{n0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{ac} - \\Phi}{V_T} \\right)\\)\n- \\(x = 0\\)\n- Time: \\(t = t_0, t_1, t_2\\)\n\nAs the voltage across the junction changes, the number of holes injected across the space charge region into the n region also changes. Figure 8.19b shows the hole concentration at the space charge edge as a function of time. At \\( t = t_0 \\), the ac voltage is zero so that the concentration of holes at \\( x = 0 \\) is just given by \\( p_n(0) = p_{n0} \\exp(V_a/V_T) \\), which is what we have seen previously.\n\nNow, as the ac voltage increases during its positive half cycle, the concentration of holes at \\( x = 0 \\) will increase and reach a peak value at \\( t = t_1 \\), which corresponds to the peak value of the ac voltage. When the ac voltage is on its negative half cycle, the total voltage across the junction decreases so that the concentration of holes at \\( x = 0 \\) decreases. The concentration reaches a minimum value at \\( t = t_2 \\), which corresponds to the time that the ac voltage reaches its maximum negative value. The minority carrier hole concentration at \\( x = 0 \\), then, has an ac component superimposed on the dc value as indicated in Figure 8.19b.\n\nAs previously discussed, the holes at the space charge edge (\\( x = 0 \\)) diffuse into the n region where they recombine with the majority carrier electrons. We assume that the period of the ac voltage is large compared to the time it takes carriers to diffuse into the n region. The hole concentration as a function of distance into the n region can then be treated as a steady-state distribution. Figure 8.19c shows the steady-state hole concentrations at three different times. At \\( t = t_0 \\), the ac voltage is zero, so the \\( t = t_0 \\) curve corresponds to the hole distribution established by the dc voltage. The \\( t = t_1 \\) curve corresponds to the distribution established when the ac voltage has reached its peak positive value, and the \\( t = t_2 \\) curve corresponds to the distribution established when the ac voltage has reached its maximum negative value. The shaded areas represent the charge \\( \\Delta Q \\) that is alternately charged and discharged during the ac voltage cycle.\n\nExactly the same process is occurring in the p region with the electron concentration. The mechanism of charging and discharging of holes in the n region and electrons in the p region leads to a capacitance. This capacitance is called diffusion capacitance. The physical mechanism of this diffusion capacitance is different from that of the junction capacitance discussed in the last chapter. We show that the magnitude of the diffusion capacitance in a forward-biased pn junction is usually substantially larger than the junction capacitance.\n\n**Mathematical Analysis**\n\nThe minority carrier distribution in the pn junction will be derived for the case when a small sinusoidal voltage is superimposed on the dc junction voltage. We can then determine small signal, or ac, diffusion currents from these minority carrier functions. Figure 8.20 shows the minority carrier distribution in a pn junction when a forward-biased dc voltage is applied. The origin, \\( x = 0 \\), is set at the edge of the space charge region on the n side for convenience. The minority carrier hole concentration at \\( x = 0 \\) is given by Equation (8.7) as \\( p_n(0) = p_{n0} \\exp(eV_a/kT) \\), where \\( V_a \\) is the applied voltage across the junction.\n\nNow let\n\n\\[\nV_a = V_0 + v(t)\n\\]\n\n(8.69)\n\n**Figure 8.20** The dc characteristics of a forward-biased pn junction used in the small-signal admittance calculations.\n\nwhere \\( V_0 \\) is the dc quiescent bias voltage and \\( v_l(t) \\) is the ac signal voltage that is superimposed on this dc level. We may now write\n\n\\[\np_n(x = 0) = p_{n0} \\exp \\left[ \\frac{e(V_0 + v_l(t))}{kT} \\right] = p_n(0, t)\n\\]\n\n(8.70)\n\nEquation (8.70) may be written as\n\n\\[\np_n(0, t) = p_{n0} \\exp \\left[ \\frac{ev_l(t)}{kT} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.71)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\np_{n0} = p_{n0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_0}{kT} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.72)\n\nIf we assume that \\( |v_l(t)| \\ll (kT/e) = V_T \\), then the exponential term in Equation (8.71) may be expanded into a Taylor series retaining only the linear terms, and the minority carrier hole concentration at \\( x = 0 \\) can be written as\n\n\\[\np_n(0, t) \\approx p_{n0} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{v_l(t)}{V_T} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.73)\n\nIf we assume that the time-varying voltage \\( v_l(t) \\) is a sinusoidal signal, we can write Equation (8.73) as\n\n\\[\np_n(0, t) = p_{n0} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{\\hat{V}_l}{V_T} e^{j\\omega t} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(8.74)\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{V}_l \\) is the phasor of the applied sinusoidal voltage. Equation (8.74) will be used as the boundary condition in the solution of the time-dependent diffusion equation for the minority carrier holes in the n region.\n\nIn the neutral n region (\\( x > 0 \\)), the electric field is assumed to be zero; thus, the behavior of the excess minority carrier holes is determined from the equation\n\n\\[\nD_p \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta p_n)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n}{\\tau_{p0}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\delta p_n)}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\n(8.75)\n\nwhere \\( \\delta p_n \\) is the excess hole concentration in the n region. We are assuming that the ac signal voltage \\( v_i (t) \\) is sinusoidal. We then expect the steady-state solution for \\( \\delta p_n \\) to be of the form of a sinusoidal solution superimposed on the dc solution, or\n\n\\[\n\\delta p_n(x, t) = \\delta p_0(x) + p_1(x)e^{j\\omega t}\n\\]\n\n(8.76)\n\nwhere \\( \\delta p_0(x) \\) is the dc excess carrier concentration and \\( p_1(x) \\) is the magnitude of the ac component of the excess carrier concentration. The expression for \\( \\delta p_0(x) \\) is the same as that given in Equation (8.14).\n\nSubstituting Equation (8.76) into the differential Equation (8.75), we obtain\n\n\\[\nD_p \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 [\\delta p_0(x)]}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 p_1(x)}{\\partial x^2} e^{j\\omega t} \\right] - \\frac{\\delta p_0(x) + p_1(x)e^{j\\omega t}}{\\tau_0} = j\\omega p_1(x)e^{j\\omega t}\n\\]\n\n(8.77)\n\nWe may rewrite this equation, combining the time-dependent and time-independent terms, as\n\n\\[\n\\left[ D_p \\frac{\\partial^2 [\\delta p_0(x)]}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_0(x)}{\\tau_0} \\right] + \\left[ D_p \\frac{\\partial^2 p_1(x)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{p_1(x)}{\\tau_0} - j\\omega p_1(x) \\right] e^{j\\omega t} = 0\n\\]\n\n(8.78)\n\nIf the ac component, \\( p_1(x) \\), is zero, then the first bracketed term is just the differential Equation (8.10), which is identically zero. Then we have, from the second bracketed term,\n\n\\[\nD_p \\frac{d^2 p_1(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{p_1(x)}{\\tau_0} - j\\omega p_1(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(8.79)\n\nNoting that \\( L_p^2 = D_p \\tau_0 \\), Equation (8.79) may be rewritten in the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 p_1(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{(1 + j\\omega \\tau_0)}{L_p^2} p_1(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(8.80)\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 p_1(x)}{dx^2} - C_p^2 p_1(x) = 0\n\\]\n\n(8.81)\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\nC_p^2 = \\frac{(1 + j\\omega \\tau_0)}{L_p^2}\n\\]\n\n(8.82)\n\nThe general solution to Equation (8.81) is\n\n\\[\np_1(x) = K_1 e^{-C_p x} + K_2 e^{C_p x}\n\\]\n\n(8.83)\n\nOne boundary condition is that \\( p_1(x \\to + \\infty) = 0 \\), which implies that the coefficient \\( K_2 = 0 \\). Then\n\n\\[\np_1(x) = K_1 e^{-C_p x}\n\\]\n\n(8.84)\n\nApplying the boundary condition at \\( x = 0 \\) from Equation (8.74), we obtain\n\n\\[\np_1(0) = K_1 = p_{n0} \\left( \\frac{V_i}{V_t} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.85)\n\nThe hole diffusion current density can be calculated at \\( x = 0 \\). This is given by\n\n\\[\nJ_p = -eD_p \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\bigg|_{x=0}\n\\]\n\n(8.86)\n\nIf we consider a homogeneous semiconductor, the derivative of the hole concentration will be just the derivative of the excess hole concentration.

The \\(\\Delta Q\\) charge is alternately being charged and discharged through the junction as the voltage across the junction changes. The change in the stored minority carrier charge as a function of the change in voltage is the diffusion capacitance. One consequence of the approximations \\(\\omega \\tau_p \\ll 1\\) and \\(\\omega \\tau_n \\ll 1\\) is that there are no “wiggles” in the minority carrier curves. The sinusoidal frequency is low enough so that the exponential curves are maintained at all times.\n\nThe diffusion capacitance tends to dominate the capacitance terms in a forward-biased pn junction. The small-signal diffusion resistance can be fairly small if the diode current is a fairly large value. As the diode current decreases, the diffusion resistance increases.

This circuit is shown in Figure 8.22a. We need to add the junction capacitance, which will be in parallel with the diffusion resistance and diffusion capacitance. The last element we add, to complete the equivalent circuit, is a series resistance. The neutral n and p regions have finite resistances so the actual pn junction will include a series resistance. The complete equivalent circuit is given in Figure 8.22b.\n\nThe voltage across the actual junction is \\( V_a \\) and the total voltage applied to the pn diode is given by \\( V_{\\text{app}} \\).

    "text": "## 8.4 | CHARGE STORAGE AND DIODE TRANSIENTS\n\nThe pn junction is typically used as an electrical switch. In forward bias, referred to as the on state, a relatively large current can be produced by a small applied voltage; in reverse bias, referred to as the off state, only a very small current will exist. Of primary interest in circuit applications is the speed of the pn junction diode in switching states. We qualitatively discuss the transients that occur and the charge storage effects. We simply state the equations that describe the switching times without any mathematical derivations.\n\n**Figure 8.24** Simple circuit for switching a diode from forward to reverse bias.\n\n### 8.4.1 The Turn-off Transient\n\nSuppose we want to switch a diode from the forward bias on state to the reverse-biased off state. Figure 8.24 shows a simple circuit that will switch the applied bias at \\( t = 0 \\). For \\( t < 0 \\), the forward-bias current is\n\n\\[\nI = I_F = \\frac{V_F - V_a}{R_F}\n\\]\n\n(8.107)\n\nThe minority carrier concentrations in the device, for the applied forward voltage \\( V_F \\), are shown in Figure 8.25a. There is excess minority carrier charge stored in both the p and n regions of the diode. The excess minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges are supported by the forward-bias junction voltage \\( V_a \\). When the voltage is switched from the forward- to the reverse-biased state, the excess minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges can no longer be supported and they start to decrease, as shown in Figure 8.25b.\n\nThe collapse of the minority carrier concentrations at the edges of the space charge region leads to large concentration gradients and diffusion currents in the reverse-biased direction. If we assume, for the moment, that the voltage across the diode junction is small compared with \\( V_R \\), then the reverse-biased current is limited to approximately\n\n\\[\nI = -I_R \\approx -\\frac{V_R}{R_R}\n\\]\n\n(8.108)\n\nThe junction capacitances do not allow the junction voltage to change instantaneously. If the current \\( I_R \\) were larger than this value, there would be a forward-bias voltage across the junction, which would violate our assumption of a reverse-biased current.\n\n**Figure 8.25** (a) Steady-state forward-bias minority carrier concentrations; (b) minority carrier concentrations at various times during switching.\n\n- **(a)**\n  - \\( n_p(x', t = 0) = n_{p0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{kT}\\right) \\)\n  - \\( p_n(x, t = 0) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_a}{kT}\\right) \\)\n  - Forward bias diffusion of electrons\n  - Forward bias diffusion of holes\n\n- **(b)**\n  - Reverse bias diffusion of electrons\n  - Reverse bias diffusion of holes\n  - \\( t = 0^- \\)\n  - \\( t = 0^+ \\)\n  - \\( t = t_1 \\)\n  - \\( t_2 \\)\n  - \\( t_3 \\)\n  - \\( t_4 = t_s \\)\n  - \\( t = \\infty \\)\n\n\n**Figure 8.26** Current characteristic versus time during diode switching.\n\n- \\( I_F \\)\n- Time\n- \\( -I_R \\)\n- \\( t_1 \\)\n- \\( t_2 = t_s \\)\n- \\( 0.1 I_R \\)\n\n\nIf the current \\( I_R \\) were smaller than this value, there would be a reverse-biased voltage across the junction, which means that the junction voltage would have changed instantaneously. Since the reverse current is limited to the value given by Equation (8.108), the reverse-biased density gradient is constant; thus, the minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edge decrease with time as shown in Figure 8.25b.\n\nThis reverse current \\( I_R \\) will be approximately constant for \\( 0^+ \\leq t \\leq t_s \\), where \\( t_s \\) is called the storage time. The storage time is the length of time required for the minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edge to reach the thermal-equilibrium values. After this time, the voltage across the junction will begin to change. The current characteristic is shown in Figure 8.26. The reverse current is the flow of the stored minority carrier charge, which is the difference between the minority carrier concentrations at \\( t = 0^- \\) and \\( t = \\infty \\), as shown in Figure 8.25b.\n\nThe storage time \\( t_s \\) can be determined by solving the time-dependent continuity equation. If we consider a one-sided p\\(^+\\)n junction, the storage time is determined from the equation\n\n\\[\n\\text{erf} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{t_s}{\\tau_{p0}}} \\right) = \\frac{I_f}{I_f + I_R}\n\\]\n\n(8.109)\n\nwhere \\(\\text{erf} (x)\\) is known as the error function. An approximate solution for the storage time can be obtained as\n\n\\[\nt_s \\approx \\tau_{p0} \\ln \\left( 1 + \\frac{I_f}{I_R} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.110)\n\nThe recovery phase for \\( t > t_s \\) is the time required for the junction to reach its steady-state reverse-biased condition. The remainder of the excess charge is being removed and the space charge width is increasing to the reverse-biased value. The decay time \\( t_z \\) is determined from\n\n\\[\n\\text{erf} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{t_z}{\\tau_{p0}}} \\right) + \\frac{\\exp(-t_z/\\tau_{p0})}{\\sqrt{\\pi t_z/\\tau_{p0}}} = 1 + 0.1 \\left( \\frac{I_f}{I_R} \\right)\n\\]\n\n(8.111)\n\nThe total turn-off time is the sum of \\( t_s \\) and \\( t_z \\).\n\nTo switch the diode quickly, we need to be able to produce a large reverse current as well as have a small minority carrier lifetime. In the design of diode circuits, then, the designer must provide a path for the transient reverse-biased current pulse in order to be able to switch the diode quickly. These same effects will be considered when we discuss the switching of bipolar transistors.\n\n### 8.4.2 The Turn-on Transient\n\nThe turn-on transient occurs when the diode is switched from its \"off\" state into the forward-bias \"on\" state. The turn-on can be accomplished by applying a forward-bias current pulse. The first stage of turn-on occurs very quickly and is the length of time required to narrow the space charge width from the reverse-biased value to its thermal-equilibrium value when \\( V_a = 0 \\). During this time, ionized donors and acceptors are neutralized as the space charge width narrows.\n\nThe second stage of the turn-on process is the time required to establish the minority carrier distributions. During this time the voltage across the junction is increasing toward its steady-state value. A small turn-on time is achieved if the minority carrier lifetime is small and if the forward-bias current is small.",

    "text": "## 8.5 The Tunnel Diode\n\nThe **tunnel diode** is a pn junction in which both the n and p regions are degenerately doped. As we discuss the operation of this device, we will find a region that exhibits a negative differential resistance. The tunnel diode was used in oscillator circuits in the past, but other types of solid-state devices are now used as high-frequency oscillators; thus, the tunnel diode is really only of academic interest. Nevertheless, this device does demonstrate the phenomenon of tunneling we discussed in Chapter 2.\n\nRecall the degenerately doped semiconductors we discussed in Chapter 4: the Fermi level is in the conduction band of a degenerately doped n-type material and in the valence band of a degenerately doped p-type material. Then, even at \\( T = 0 \\, K \\), electrons will exist in the conduction band of the n-type material, and holes (empty states) will exist in the p-type material.\n\nFigure 8.27 shows the energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium for the case when both the n and p regions are degenerately doped. The depletion region width decreases as the doping increases and may be on the order of approximately 100 Å for the case shown in Figure 8.27. The potential barrier at the junction can be approximated by a triangular potential barrier, as shown in Figure 8.28. This potential barrier is similar to the potential barrier used in Chapter 2 to illustrate the tunneling phenomenon. The barrier width is small and the electric field in the space charge region is quite large; thus, a finite probability exists that an electron may tunnel through the forbidden band from one side of the junction to the other.\n\nWe may qualitatively determine the current–voltage characteristics of the tunnel diode by considering the simplified energy-band diagrams in Figure 8.29.\n\n**Figure 8.27** | Energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium in which both the n and p regions are degenerately doped.\n\n**Figure 8.28** | Triangular potential barrier approximation of the potential barrier in the tunnel diode.\n\n**Figure 8.29** | Simplified energy-band diagrams and \\( I \\text{-} V \\) characteristics of the tunnel diode at (a) zero bias; (b) a slight forward bias; (c) a forward bias producing maximum tunneling current. *(continued)*\n\n- **(a)** Zero bias: The energy-band diagram shows no applied voltage, and the corresponding \\( I \\text{-} V \\) characteristic is at the origin.\n- **(b)** Slight forward bias: The energy-band diagram indicates a small forward voltage, and the \\( I \\text{-} V \\) curve begins to rise.\n- **(c)** Forward bias producing maximum tunneling current: The energy-band diagram shows increased forward bias, and the \\( I \\text{-} V \\) curve reaches a peak.\n\n**Figure 8.29** | (concluded) (d) A higher forward bias showing less tunneling current; (e) a forward bias for which the diffusion current dominates.\n\nFigure 8.29a shows the energy-band diagram at zero bias, which produces zero current on the I–V diagram. If we assume, for simplicity, that we are near 0 K, then all energy states are filled below \\( E_F \\) on both sides of the junction.\n\nFigure 8.29b shows the situation when a small forward-bias voltage is applied to the junction. Electrons in the conduction band of the n region are directly opposite to empty states in the valence band of the p region. There is a finite probability that some of these electrons will tunnel directly into the empty states, producing a forward-bias tunneling current as shown. With a slightly larger forward-bias voltage, as in Figure 8.29c, the maximum number of electrons in the n region will be opposite the maximum number of empty states in the p region; this will produce a maximum tunneling current.\n\nAs the forward-bias voltage continues to increase, the number of electrons on the n side directly opposite empty states on the p side decreases, as in Figure 8.29d, and the tunneling current will decrease. In Figure 8.29e, there are no electrons on the n side directly opposite to available empty states on the p side. For this forward-bias voltage, the tunneling current will be zero and the normal ideal diffusion current will exist in the device as shown in the I–V characteristics.\n\n**Figure 8.30** (a) Simplified energy-band diagram of a tunnel diode with a reverse-biased voltage; (b) I–V characteristic of a tunnel diode with a reverse-biased voltage.\n\nThe portion of the curve showing a decrease in current with an increase in voltage is the region of differential negative resistance. The range of voltage and current for this region is quite small; thus, any power generated from an oscillator using this negative resistance property would also be fairly small.\n\nA simplified energy-band diagram of the tunnel diode with an applied reverse-biased voltage is shown in Figure 8.30a. Electrons in the valence band on the p side are directly opposite empty states in the conduction band on the n side, so electrons can now tunnel directly from the p region into the n region, resulting in a large reverse-biased tunneling current. This tunneling current will exist for any reverse-biased voltage. The reverse-biased current will increase monotonically and rapidly with reverse-biased voltage as shown in Figure 8.30b.",

The behavior of the excess minority carrier is described by the ambipolar transport equation developed and described in Chapter 6. Solving the ambipolar transport equation and using the boundary conditions, the steady-state minority carrier hole and electron concentrations in the n region and p region, respectively, were derived.\n- Gradients exist in the minority carrier hole and electron concentrations so that minority carrier diffusion currents exist in the pn junction. These diffusion currents yield the ideal current–voltage relationship of the pn junction diode.\n- Excess carriers are generated in the space charge region of a reverse-biased pn junction. These carriers are swept out by the electric field and create the reverse-biased generation current that is another component of the reverse-biased diode current. Excess carriers recombine in the space charge region of a forward-biased pn junction. This recombination process creates the forward-bias recombination current that is another component of the forward-bias diode current.\n- The small-signal equivalent circuit of the pn junction diode was developed. The two parameters of interest are the diffusion resistance and the diffusion capacitance.\n- When a pn junction is switched from forward bias to reverse bias, the stored excess minority carrier charge must be removed from the junction.

Electrons tunnel through the potential barrier into the empty states producing a tunneling current.

The parameter \\( C_j \\) is the junction capacitance, and the parameters \\( L_p \\) and \\( R_p \\) are the parasitic or interconnect line inductance and resistance, respectively.\n\nThe small signal input impedance can be written as\n\n\\[\nZ = \\left[ R_p - \\frac{R_{\\text{min}}}{1 + \\omega^2 R_{\\text{min}}^2 C_j^2} \\right] + j\\omega \\left[ L_p - \\frac{\\omega R_{\\text{min}}^2 C_j}{1 + \\omega^2 R_{\\text{min}}^2 C_j^2} \\right]\n\\]\n\n(15.1)\n\nThe resistive part of the impedance goes to zero at a frequency of\n\n\\[\nf_r = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{\\text{min}} C_j} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{min}}}{R_p} - 1}\n\\]\n\n(15.2)\n\nFor frequencies \\( f > f_r \\), the resistive part of the impedance becomes positive so that the diode loses its negative differential resistance characteristic. The operating frequency must then occur at \\( f_0 < f_r \\). The frequency \\( f_r \\) is referred to as the maximum resistive cutoff frequency.\n\nThe tunneling process is a majority carrier effect so the diode does not exhibit time delays due to minority carrier diffusion, which means that the diode is capable of operating at microwave frequencies. However, due to the relatively small voltage range in which the diode exhibits the negative resistance characteristic, the tunnel diode is not used extensively.\n\nAnother negative differential resistance device is the GUNN diode, or Transferred-Electron Device (TED). The transferred-electron phenomenon is demonstrated in a few semiconductors in which conduction electrons in a high-mobility band are scattered to a low-mobility band by a high electric field. In Chapter 5, we discussed the drift velocity of electrons in GaAs versus electric field. Figure 15.3 again shows a plot of this characteristic. InP also shows this same characteristic.\n\nFigure 15.4 shows an expanded plot of the energy-band structure in GaAs that is given in Figure 5.8.

A small effective mass leads to a large mobility value.\n\nAs the electric field increases above a threshold or critical value, \\( E_{th} \\), the electrons gain more than the 0.3 eV energy separating the two valleys so that electrons can be scattered into the upper valley, where the density of states electron effective mass is much larger. The larger effective mass yields a smaller mobility.

A small space charge region may develop in the material near the cathode as shown in Figure 15.5b. As a result, the electric field increases in this region as shown in Figure 15.5c. (Special device structures can be fabricated to ensure that the space charge fluctuations are generated near the cathode.)\n\n**Figure 15.5** (a) A simplified two-terminal GaAs device. (b) Electron concentration versus distance showing a space charge formation. (c) Electric field versus distance.\n\nIn discussing excess carrier behavior in Chapter 6, we found the time behavior of a net charge density in a semiconductor to be given by\n\n\\[\n\\delta Q(t) = \\delta Q(0)e^{-t/\\tau_d}\n\\]\n\n(15.3)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau_d\\) is the dielectric relaxation time constant and is on the order of a picosecond. Normally, a small space charge region would be quickly neutralized. The dielectric relaxation time constant is given by \\(\\tau_d = \\varepsilon/\\sigma\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is the semiconductor conductivity. If the GaAs is biased in the negative mobility region, then the conductivity is negative and the exponent in Equation (15.3) becomes positive, so the space charge region, now called a domain, can actually build up as it drifts toward the anode. As the domain grows (Figure 15.6a), the electric field in this region increases which means that the electric field in the remaining material decreases. The E field in the material outside of the domain can drop below the critical value, as indicated in Figure 15.6b, while the E field within the domain remains above the critical value. For this reason, only one domain will normally be established in the material at any given time.\n\nAs the domain reaches the anode, a current pulse is induced in the external circuit. After the domain reaches the anode, another domain may form near the cathode and the process repeats itself. Thus, a series of current pulses may be generated as shown in Figure 15.7. The time between current pulses is the time for the domain to drift through the device. The oscillation frequency is given by\n\n\\[\nf = 1/\\tau = v_d/L\n\\]\n\n(15.4)\n\nwhere \\(v_d\\) is the average drift velocity and \\(L\\) is the length of the drift region.\n\n**Figure 15.6** (a) Electron concentration versus distance showing a domain.

More complex modes of operation are possible. Studies have shown that the efficiency of the transit-time device is largest when the product \\( n_0 L \\) is a few times \\( 10^{12} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\). For this case, the domain fills about one-half of the drift region length and produces a current output that is nearly sinusoidal. The maximum dc-to-rf conversion efficiency is approximately 10 percent.\n\nOscillations in the frequency range of 1 to 100 GHz or higher can be obtained. If the device is operated in a pulsed mode, a peak output power in the range of hundreds of watts can be produced.

The IMPATT diode consists of a high-field avalanche region and a drift region that produces a dynamic negative resistance at microwave frequencies. The negative resistance characteristic produced in this device is a result of a time delay so that the ac current and voltage components are out of phase, and is a different phenomenon compared to the tunnel diode, for example. The tunnel diode has a negative \\( dI/dV \\) region in the \\( I-V \\) characteristic.\n\nOne example of an IMPATT diode is a \\( p^+ \\)-\\( n^- \\)-\\( i \\)-\\( n^+ \\) structure as shown in Figure 15.8a. Typical doping concentrations (magnitudes) are shown in Figure 15.8b. The device is reverse biased so that the \\( n \\) and intrinsic regions are completely depleted. The electric field in the device is shown in Figure 15.8c. We may note that\n\n\\[\nE \\, dt = V_B\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V_B \\) is the applied reverse-biased voltage. The value of \\( V_B \\) is very close to the breakdown voltage. The avalanche region is localized near the pn junction. The electric field in the intrinsic region is nearly constant and the intrinsic layer provides the drift region.\n\n**Figure 15.8** (a) An IMPATT diode structure.

(c) Electric field versus distance through the IMPATT diode.\n\n**Figure 15.9** Circuit for an IMPATT diode oscillator.\n\nFigure 15.9 shows the circuit for an IMPATT diode oscillator. An LC resonant circuit is required for the oscillator operation. During the positive ac voltage across the LC circuit as shown in the figure, the diode goes into breakdown and electron-hole pairs are generated at the p⁺n junction. The generated electrons flow back into the p⁺ region, while the holes start drifting through the depleted intrinsic region. In general, the holes will travel at their saturation velocity. During the negative ac voltage, the device operates below the breakdown voltage so electron-hole pairs are no longer produced.\n\nThere is an inherent \\(\\pi/2\\) phase shift between the peak value of the avalanche voltage at the p⁺n junction and the injection of the holes into the intrinsic drift region due to the finite buildup time of the avalanche generated electron-hole pairs. A further delay of \\(\\pi/2\\) is then required during the drift process to provide the total 180 degrees of phase shift between the current and voltage at the output terminal. The transit time of the holes is \\(\\tau = L/v_s\\), where \\(L\\) is the length of the drift region and \\(v_s\\) is the saturation velocity of the holes. The LC circuit resonant frequency must be designed to be equal to the device resonant frequency, which is given by\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1}{2\\tau} = \\frac{v_s}{2L}\n\\]\n\n(15.5)\n\nWhen the holes reach the n⁺ cathode, the current is at a maximum value and the voltage is at its minimum value.

    "text": "## 15.4 | Power Bipolar Transistors\n\nIn our previous discussions, we have ignored any physical transistor limitations in terms of maximum current, voltage, and power. We implicitly assumed that the transistors are capable of handling the current and voltage, and could handle the power dissipated within the device without suffering any damage.\n\nHowever, with power transistors, we must be concerned with various transistor limitations. The limitations involve maximum rated current (on the order of amperes), maximum rated voltage (on the order of 100 V), and maximum rated power (on the order of watts or tens of watts).[^1]\n\n### 15.4.1 Vertical Power Transistor Structure\n\nFigure 15.10 shows the structure of a vertical npn power transistor. We have considered vertical npn bipolar transistors previously. However, with small switching devices, the collector terminal is still formed at the surface. In the vertical configuration for the power bipolar transistor, the collector terminal is at the “bottom” of the device. This configuration is preferred since it maximizes the cross-sectional area through which current is flowing in the device. In addition, the doping concentrations\n\n\n**Figure 15.10** | Cross section of typical vertical npn power BJT.\n\n[^1]: We must note that, in general, the maximum rated current and maximum rated voltage cannot occur at the same time.\n\n**Figure 15.11** | An interdigitated bipolar transistor structure showing the top view and cross-sectional view.\n\nand dimensions are not the same as we have encountered in small switching transistors. The primary collector region has a low-doped impurity concentration so that a large base–collector voltage can be applied without initiating breakdown. Another n region, with a higher doping concentration, reduces collector resistance and makes contact with the external collector terminal. The base region is also much wider than normally encountered in small devices. A large base–collector voltage implies a relatively large space charge width being induced in both the collector and base regions. A relatively large base width is required to prevent punch-through breakdown.\n\nPower transistors must also be large-area devices in order to handle large currents. We have previously considered the interdigitated structure that is repeated in Figure 15.11. Relatively small emitter widths are required to prevent the emitter current crowding effects that were discussed in Section 12.4.4.\n\n### 15.4.2 Power Transistor Characteristics\n\nThe relatively wide base width implies a much smaller current gain \\( \\beta \\) for power transistors compared to small switching transistors, and large area device implies a larger junction capacitance and hence lower cutoff frequency for a power transistor compared to a small switching transistor.

The current gain is generally smaller in the power transistors, typically in the range of 20 to 100, and may be a strong function of collector current and temperature. Figure 15.12 shows typical current gain versus collector current characteristics for the 2N3055 power BJT at various temperatures.\n\nThe **maximum rated collector current** \\( I_{C,max} \\) may be related to the maximum current that the wires connecting the semiconductor to the external terminals can handle, the collector current at which the current gain falls below a minimum specified value, or the current that leads to the maximum power dissipation when the transistor is biased in saturation.\n\nThe **maximum rated voltage** in a BJT is generally associated with avalanche breakdown in the reverse-biased base–collector junction. In the common-emitter configuration, the breakdown voltage mechanism also involves the transistor gain, as well as the breakdown phenomenon in the pn junction. This is discussed in Section 12.4.6. Typical \\( I_C \\) versus \\( V_{CE} \\) characteristics are shown in Figure 15.13.\n\n**Figure 15.12** Typical dc beta characteristics (\\( h_{FE} \\) versus \\( I_C \\)) for 2N3055.\n\n**Figure 15.13** Typical collector current versus collector–emitter voltage characteristics of a bipolar transistor, showing breakdown effects.\n\nFigure 15.14\n\nThe safe operating area (SOA) of a bipolar transistor plotted on:\n\n- (a) Linear scales\n- (b) Logarithmic scales\n\n (a) Linear Scales\n\n- **Axes:**\n  - \\( I_C \\) (A)\n  - \\( V_{CE} \\) (V)\n\n- **Key Points:**\n  - \\( I_{C,\\text{max}} \\)\n  - \\( P_T \\)\n  - Second breakdown\n  - \\( V_{CE,\\text{max}} \\)\n\n (b) Logarithmic Scales\n\n- **Axes:**\n  - \\( I_C \\) (A)\n  - \\( V_{CE} \\) (V)\n\n- **Key Points:**\n  - Maximum current limit\n  - \\( P_T \\)\n  - Second breakdown\n  - \\( V_{CE,\\text{max}} \\)\n\n#### Explanation\n\nWhen the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, the collector current begins to increase significantly before the actual breakdown voltage is reached. All the curves tend to merge to the same collector–emitter voltage once breakdown has occurred. This voltage, \\( V_{CE,\\text{max}} \\), is the minimum voltage necessary to sustain the transistor in breakdown.\n\nAnother breakdown effect is called **second breakdown**, which occurs in a BJT operating at high voltage and high current. Slight nonuniformities in current density produce local regions of increased heating that increases the minority carrier concentrations in the semiconductor material, which in turn increases the current in these regions. This effect results in positive feedback, and the current continues to increase, producing a further increase in temperature, until the semiconductor material may actually melt, creating a short circuit between the collector and emitter.\n\nThe average power dissipated in a BJT must be kept below a specified maximum value, to ensure that the temperature of the device remains below a maximum value. If we assume the collector current and collector–emitter voltage are dc values, then at the maximum rated power \\( P_T \\) for the transistor, we can write:\n\n\\[\nP_T = V_{CE} I_C\n\\]\n\nEquation (15.6) neglects the \\( V_{BE} I_B \\) component of power dissipation in the transistor.\n\nThe maximum current, voltage, and power limitations can be illustrated on the \\( I_C \\) versus \\( V_{CE} \\) characteristics as shown in Figure 15.14. The average power limitation, \\( P_T \\), is a hyperbola described by Equation (15.6). The region where the transistor can be operated safely is known as the safe operating area (SOA) and is bounded by \\( I_{C,\\text{max}} \\), \\( V_{CE,\\text{max}} \\), \\( P_T \\), and the transistor’s second breakdown characteristic curve. Figure 15.14a shows the safe operating area using linear current and voltage scales. Figure 15.14b shows the same characteristics using log scales.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{[M} & \\, \\text{C} = (\\exists u)(d \\, \\forall s = (\\exists u))^u \\, \\forall s = \\gamma y' (s) \\land \\text{C} = (\\exists u)(d \\, \\forall s = (\\exists u))^u \\\\\n& \\, \\forall s = \\gamma y' (q) : \\land \\, 0 \\text{E} = (\\exists u)(d \\, \\forall x = (\\exists u))^u \\, 0 \\text{E} = \\gamma y' (q) \\, \\text{SU} \\, \\text{V}]\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### 15.4.3 Darlington Pair Configuration\n\nAs mentioned, the base width of a power BJT is relatively wide so that the current gain is then relatively small. One method that is used to increase the effective current gain is to use a Darlington pair such as shown in Figure 15.17. Considering the currents, we see that\n\n\\[\ni_C = i_{CA} + i_{CB} = \\beta_A i_B + \\beta_B i_{EA} = \\beta_A i_B + \\beta_B (\\beta_A i_B) = \\beta_A i_B (1 + \\beta_B) = \\beta i_B\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(15.7)\n\\]\n\n\n**Figure 15.17** | An npn Darlington pair configuration.\n\n**Figure 15.18** | An integrated circuit implementation of the npn Darlington pair configuration.\n\nThe overall common-emitter current gain is then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{i_c}{i_b} = \\beta_A \\beta_B + \\beta_A + \\beta_B\n\\]\n\n(15.8)\n\nThus, if the gain of each individual transistor is \\(\\beta_A = \\beta_B = 15\\), then the overall gain of the Darlington pair is \\(\\frac{i_c}{i_b} = 255\\). This overall gain is then substantially larger than that of the individual device. A diode may be incorporated as shown in Figure 15.17 to aid in turning off the transistor \\(Q_A\\). A reverse current out of the base of \\(Q_B\\) through the diode will pull charge out of the base of this transistor and turn the device off faster than when no diode is used.\n\nThe Darlington pair shown in Figure 15.17 is typically used in the output stage of a power amplifier when an npn bipolar transistor is required. A pnp Darlington pair may also be used to increase the effective current gain of a power pnp device.\n\nThe integrated circuit configuration of the npn Darlington pair may be as shown in Figure 15.18. The silicon dioxide that is shown completely penetrates through the p-type base region so that the base regions of the two transistors are isolated.\n\n\n**Figure 15.19** | Figure for Exercise TYU 15.2.",

    "text": "## 15.5 Power MOSFETs\n\nThe basic operation of the power MOSFET is the same as that of any MOSFET. However, the current handling capability of these devices is usually in the ampere range, and the drain-to-source blocking voltage may be in the range of 50 to 100 volts or even higher. One big advantage that a power MOSFET has over a bipolar power device is that the control signal is applied to the gate whose input impedance is extremely large. Even during switching between on and off states, the gate current is small, so that relatively large currents can be switched with very small control currents.\n\n### 15.5.1 Power Transistor Structures\n\nLarge currents can be obtained in a MOSFET with a very large channel width. To achieve a large channel width device with good characteristics, power MOSFETs are fabricated with a repetitive pattern of small cells operating in parallel. To achieve a large blocking voltage, a vertical structure is used. There are two basic power MOSFET structures. The first is called a DMOS device and is shown in Figure 15.20. The DMOS device uses a double diffusion process: The p-base or the p-substrate region and the n⁺ source contact are diffused through a common window defined by the edge of the gate. The p-base region is diffused deeper than the n⁺ source, and the difference in the lateral diffusion distance between the p-base and the n⁺ source defines the surface channel length.\n\nElectrons enter the source terminal and flow laterally through the inversion layer under the gate to the n-drift region. The electrons then flow vertically through the n-drift region to the drain terminal. The conventional current direction is from the drain to the source. The n-drift region must be moderately doped so that the drain breakdown voltage is sufficiently large. However, the thickness of the n-drift region should also be as thin as possible to minimize drain resistance.\n\nThe second power MOSFET structure, shown in Figure 15.21, is a VMOS structure. The vertical channel or VMOS power device is a nonplanar structure that requires a different type of fabrication process. In this case, a p-base or p⁺-substrate diffusion\n\n**Figure 15.20** | Cross section of a double-diffused MOS (DMOS) transistor.\n\n**Figure 15.21** | Cross section of a vertical channel MOS (VMOS) transistor.\n\n**Figure 15.22 | A HEXFET structure.**\n\nis performed over the entire surface followed by the n\\(^+\\) source diffusion. A V-shaped groove is then formed, extending through the n-drift region. It has been found that certain chemical solutions etch the (111) planes in silicon at a much slower rate than the other planes. If (100) oriented silicon is etched through a window at the surface, these chemical etches will create a V-shaped groove. A gate oxide is then grown in the V-shaped groove and the metal gate material is deposited. An electron inversion layer is formed in the base or substrate so that current is again essentially a vertical current between the source and the drain. The relatively low-doped n-drift region supports the drain voltage since the depletion region extends mainly into this low-doped region.\n\nWe mentioned that many individual MOSFET cells are connected in parallel to fabricate a power MOSFET with the proper width-to-length ratio. Figure 15.22 shows a HEXFET structure. Each cell is a DMOS device with an n\\(^+\\) polysilicon gate. The HEXFET has a very high packing density—it may be on the order of 10\\(^5\\) cells per cm\\(^2\\). In the VMOS structure, the anisotropic etching of the grooves must be along the [110] direction on the (100) surface. This constraint limits the design options available for this type of device.\n\n### 15.5.2 Power MOSFET Characteristics\n\nTable 15.2 lists the basic parameters of two n-channel power MOSFETs. The drain currents are in the ampere range and the breakdown voltages are in the hundreds of volts range.\n\nAn important parameter of a power MOSFET is the **on resistance**, which can be written as\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{on}} = R_S + R_{\\text{CH}} + R_D \\tag{15.9}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( R_S \\) is the resistance associated with the source contact, \\( R_{\\text{CH}} \\) is the channel resistance, and \\( R_D \\) is the resistance associated with the drain contact. The \\( R_S \\) and \\( R_D \\)\n\nTable 15.2 Characteristics of Two Power MOSFETs\n\n| Parameter                  | 2N6757 | 2N6792 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| \\( V_{DS}(\\text{max}) \\) (V) | 150    | 400    |\n| \\( I_D(\\text{max}) \\) (at \\( T = 25^\\circ C \\)) | 8      | 2      |\n| \\( P_D \\) (W)              | 75     | 20     |\n\nResistance values are not necessarily negligible in power MOSFETs since small resistances and high currents can produce considerable power dissipation.\n\nIn the linear region of operation, we may write the channel resistance as:\n\n\\[\nR_{CH} = \\frac{L}{W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)}\n\\]\n\nWe have noted in previous chapters that mobility decreases with increasing temperature. The threshold voltage varies only slightly with temperature so that, as current in a device increases and produces additional power dissipation, the temperature of the device increases, the carrier mobility decreases, and \\( R_{CH} \\) increases, which inherently limits the channel current. The resistances \\( R_S \\) and \\( R_D \\) are proportional to semiconductor resistivity and so are also inversely proportional to mobility and have the same temperature characteristics as \\( R_{CH} \\). Figure 15.23 shows a typical “on-resistance” characteristic as a function of drain current.\n\nThe increase in resistance with temperature provides stability for the power MOSFET. If the current in any particular cell begins to increase, the resulting temperature rise will increase the resistance, thus limiting the current. With this particular characteristic, the total current in a power MOSFET tends to be evenly distributed among the parallel cells, not concentrated in any single cell, a condition that can cause burnout.\n\n\n**Figure 15.23** Typical drain-to-source resistance versus drain current characteristics of a MOSFET.\n\n- \\( R_{DS(\\text{on})} \\) measured with current pulse of 2.0-μs duration, initial \\( T_j = 25^\\circ C \\) (heating effect of 2.0-μs pulse is minimal)\n- \\( V_{GS} = 10 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n- \\( V_{GS} = 20 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n\nThe graph shows \\( R_{DS(\\text{on})} \\) as a function of \\( I_D \\), drain current (A), with resistance (Ω) on the y-axis.\n\n\n**Figure 15.24** | Typical characteristics for high-power MOSFETs at various temperatures: (a) transconductance versus drain current; (b) drain current versus gate-to-source voltage.\n\nPower MOSFETs differ from bipolar power transistors in both operating principles and performance. The superior performance characteristics of power MOSFETs are faster switching times, no second breakdown, and stable gain and response time over a wide temperature range. Figure 15.24a shows the transconductance of the 2N6757 versus temperature. The variation with temperature of the MOSFET transconductance is less than the variation in the BJT current gain that is shown in Figure 15.12. Figure 15.24b is a plot of drain current versus gate-to-source voltage at three different temperatures. We may note that at high current, the current decreases with temperature at a constant gate-to-source voltage, providing the stability that has been discussed.\n\nPower MOSFETs must operate in a SOA. As with power BJTs, the SOA is defined by three factors: the maximum drain current, \\(I_{D,\\text{max}}\\), rated breakdown voltage, \\(BV_{\\text{DSS}}\\), and the maximum power dissipation given by \\(P_T = V_{DS}I_D\\). The SOA is shown in Figure 15.25a in which the current and voltage are plotted on linear scales.\n\n!Graphs\n\n**Figure 15.25** | The safe operating area (SOA) of a MOSFET plotted on (a) linear scales and (b) logarithmic scales.\n\n- Maximum power dissipation: \\( P_T = V_{DS}I_D \\)\n\n- **Figure 15.24a**: Transconductance vs. Drain Current\n  - \\( V_{DS} = 15 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n  - \\( T_J = -55^\\circ \\text{C}, 25^\\circ \\text{C}, 125^\\circ \\text{C} \\)\n  - 80-\\(\\mu\\)s pulse test\n\n- **Figure 15.24b**: Drain Current vs. Gate-to-Source Voltage\n  - \\( V_{DS} = 15 \\, \\text{V} \\)\n  - \\( T_J = -55^\\circ \\text{C}, 25^\\circ \\text{C}, 125^\\circ \\text{C} \\)\n  - 80-\\(\\mu\\)s pulse test\n\n- **Figure 15.25a**: SOA on Linear Scales\n  - \\( I_D \\) vs. \\( V_{DS} \\)\n  - \\( I_{D,\\text{max}} \\), \\( BV_{\\text{DSS}} \\), \\( P_T \\)\n\n- **Figure 15.25b**: SOA on Logarithmic Scales\n  - \\( \\log I_D \\) vs. \\( \\log V_{DS} \\)\n  - \\( \\log I_{D,\\text{max}} \\), \\( \\log BV_{\\text{DSS}} \\), \\( P_T \\)\n\n### 15.5.3 Parasitic BJT\n\nThe MOSFET has a parasitic BJT as an inherent part of its structure. The parasitic BJT may be seen in both the DMOS and VMOS structures shown in Figures 15.20 and 15.21. The source terminal corresponds to the n-type emitter, the p-type base or substrate region corresponds to the p-type base, and the n-type drain corresponds to the n-type collector. This is also shown schematically in Figure 15.28. The channel length of the MOSFET corresponds to the base width of the parasitic BJT. Since this length is normally quite small, the current gain \\(\\beta\\) of the BJT can be larger than unity.\n\n\n**Figure 15.28** (a) Cross section of vertical MOSFET showing parasitic BJT and distributed resistance; (b) equivalent circuit of MOSFET and parasitic BJT with distributed parameters.\n\nThe BJT should be cutoff at all times, which means the source-to-body voltage (emitter-to-base voltage) should be as close to zero as possible. We see from the geometries of Figures 15.20 and 15.21 that the source ohmic contact also goes across the p-type body region so that this junction voltage is zero during steady-state operation of the transistor. However, the BJT may be turned on during high-speed switching of the MOSFET.\n\nFigure 15.28b shows that the base and the collector of the parasitic BJT are connected by the gate-to-drain capacitance. A parasitic or distributed resistance also connects the base to the emitter of the BJT. When the MOSFET is being turned off, the drain-to-source voltage increases and induces a current in the gate-to-drain capacitance in the direction from the parasitic collector terminal to the parasitic base terminal. This induced current may be large enough to induce a voltage in the parasitic resistance that is sufficient to forward bias the base–emitter junction and therefore turn the BJT on. The turned on BJT may then induce a large drain current that can cause burnout of the MOSFET. This breakdown mechanism is known as **snapback breakdown** and has been discussed briefly in Section 11.4.1.",

    "text": "## 15.6 The Thyristor\n\nThe current–voltage characteristics are shown in Figure 11.22. Devices can be designed to minimize the parasitic or distributed base–emitter resistance to minimize this problem.\n\n### 15.6.1 The Thyristor\n\nOne of the important applications of electronic devices is in switching between an off or blocking state to an on or low-impedance state. Thyristor is the name given to a general class of semiconductor pnpn switching devices that exhibit bistable regenerative switching characteristics. We have considered the transistor, which may be switched on with the application of a base drive or a gate voltage. The base drive or gate voltage must be applied as long as the transistor is to remain on. There are a number of applications in which it is useful to have a device remain in a blocking state until switched to the low-impedance state by a control signal, which then does not necessarily have to remain on. These devices are efficient in switching large currents at low frequencies, such as industrial control circuits operating at 60 Hz.\n\nA Semiconductor Controlled Rectifier (SCR) is the common name given to a three-terminal thyristor. The SCR (sometimes referred to as a silicon controlled rectifier) is a four-layer pnpn structure with a gate control terminal. As with most semiconductor devices, there are several variations of the device structure. We consider the basic SCR operation and limitations, and then discuss some variations of the basic four-layer device.\n\n### 15.6.1 The Basic Characteristics\n\nThe four-layer pnpn structure is shown in Figure 15.29a. The upper p region is called the anode and the lower n region is called the cathode. If a positive voltage is applied to the anode, the device is said to be forward biased. However, the junction \\( J_2 \\) is reverse biased so that only a very small current exists. If a negative voltage is applied to the anode, then junctions \\( J_1 \\) and \\( J_3 \\) are reverse biased—again only a very small current will exist. Figure 15.29b shows the I–V characteristics for these conditions. The voltage \\( V_B \\) is the breakdown voltage of the \\( J_2 \\) junction. For properly designed devices, the blocking voltage can be several thousand volts.\n\nTo consider the characteristics of the device as it goes into its conducting state, we can model the structure as coupled npn and pnp bipolar transistors. Figure 15.30a shows how we can split the four-layer structure and Figure 15.30b shows the two-transistor equivalent circuit with the associated currents. Since the base of the pnp device is the same as the collector of the npn transistor, the base current \\( I_{B1} \\) must in fact be the same as the collector current \\( I_{C2} \\). Similarly, since the collector of the pnp transistor is the same as the base of the npn device, the collector current \\( I_{C1} \\) must be the same as the base current \\( I_{B2} \\). In this bias configuration, the B–C of the pnp and the B–C of the npn devices are reverse biased, while the B–E junctions are both forward biased. The parameters \\( \\alpha_1 \\) and \\( \\alpha_2 \\) are the common base current gains of the pnp and npn transistors, respectively.\n\n**Figure 15.29**  \n(a) The basic four-layer pnpn structure.  \n(b) The initial current–voltage characteristic of the pnpn device.\n\n- **(a) Diagram:**\n  - Anode (A)\n  - Cathode (K)\n  - Layers: p, n, p, n\n  - Currents: \\( I_A \\), \\( J_1 \\), \\( J_2 \\), \\( J_3 \\)\n  - Voltage: \\( V_A \\)\n\n- **(b) Graph:**\n  - Reverse blocking\n  - Forward blocking\n  - Voltage: \\( V_A \\)\n  - Voltage point: \\( V_p \\)\n\n\n**Figure 15.30**  \n(a) The splitting of the basic pnpn structure.  \n(b) Two two-transistor equivalent circuit of the four-layer pnpn device.\n\n- **(a) Diagram:**\n  - Anode (A)\n  - Cathode (K)\n  - Layers: p, n, p, n\n  - Currents: \\( I_A \\), \\( I_K \\)\n  - Voltage: \\( V_A \\)\n\n- **(b) Diagram:**\n  - Equivalent circuit\n  - Currents: \\( I_{B1} = I_{C2} \\), \\( I_{C1} = I_{B2} \\)\n\nWe can write:\n\n\\[\nI_{C1} = \\alpha_1 I_A + I_{C01} = I_{B2} \\tag{15.11a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nI_{C2} = \\alpha_2 I_K + I_{C02} = I_{B1} \\tag{15.11b}\n\\]\nwhere \\( I_{C01} \\) and \\( I_{C02} \\) are the reverse B–C junction saturation currents in the two devices. In this particular configuration, \\( I_A = I_K \\) and \\( I_{C1} + I_{C2} = I_A \\). If we add Equations (15.11a) and (15.11b), we obtain\n\n\\[\nI_{C1} + I_{C2} = I_A = (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2) I_A + I_{C01} + I_{C02}\n\\]\n\nThe anode current \\( I_A \\), from Equation (15.12), can be found as\n\n\\[\nI_A = \\frac{I_{C01} + I_{C02}}{1 - (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)}\n\\]\n\nAs long as \\( \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 \\) is much smaller than unity, the anode current is small, as we have indicated in Figure 15.29b.\n\nThe common base current gains, \\( \\alpha_1 \\) and \\( \\alpha_2 \\), are very strong functions of collector current as we discussed in Chapter 12. For small values of \\( V_A \\), the collector current in each device is just the reverse saturation current, which is very small. The small collector current implies that both \\( \\alpha_1 \\) and \\( \\alpha_2 \\) are much smaller than unity. The four-layer structure maintains this blocking condition until the junction \\( J_2 \\) starts into breakdown or until a current is induced in the \\( J_2 \\) junction by some external means.\n\nConsider, initially, the condition when the applied anode voltage is sufficiently large to cause the \\( J_2 \\) junction to start into avalanche breakdown. This effect is shown in Figure 15.31a. The electrons generated by impact ionization are swept into the \\( n_1 \\) region, making the \\( n_1 \\) region more negative, and the holes generated by impact ionization are swept into the \\( p_2 \\) region, making the \\( p_2 \\) region more positive. The more negative voltage of the \\( n_1 \\) region and the more positive voltage of the \\( p_2 \\) region means that the forward-bias junction voltages \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_3 \\) both increase. The increase in the respective B–E junction voltages causes an increase in current, which results in an increase in the common-base current gains \\( \\alpha_1 \\) and \\( \\alpha_2 \\), causing a further increase in\n\n\n**Figure 15.31** (a) The pnpn device when the \\( J_2 \\) junction starts into avalanche breakdown.

The total voltage across the device decreases and is approximately equal to one diode drop. The current in the device is limited by the external circuit. If the current is allowed to increase, ohmic losses may become important, slightly increasing the voltage drop across the device with current. The \\( I_A \\) versus \\( V_A \\) characteristic is shown in Figure 15.32.\n\n### 15.6.2 Triggering the SCR\n\nIn the last section, we considered the case when the four-layer pnpn device is turned on by the avalanche breakdown process in the center junction. The turn-on condition can also be initiated by other means. Figure 15.33a shows three-terminal SCR in which the third terminal is the gate control. We can determine the effect of the gate current by reconsidering Equations (15.11a) and (15.11b).\n\nFigure 15.33b again shows the two-transistor equivalent circuit including the gate current. We can write:\n\n\\[\nI_{C1} = \\alpha_1 I_A + I_{CO1} \\tag{15.14a}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nI_{C2} = \\alpha_2 I_K + I_{CO2} \\tag{15.14b}\n\\]\n\nWe now have \\( I_K = I_A + I_G \\), and we can still write \\( I_{C1} + I_{C2} = I_A \\). Adding Equations (15.14a) and (15.14b), we find that\n\n\\[\nI_{C1} + I_{C2} = I_A = (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2) I_A + \\alpha_2 I_G + I_{CO1} + I_{CO2} \\tag{15.15}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( I_a \\), we find\n\n\\[\nI_a = \\frac{\\alpha_2 I_c + (I_{co1} + I_{co2})}{1 - (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)}\n\\]\n\n(15.16)\n\nWe can think of the gate current as the flow of holes into the \\( p_2 \\) region. The additional holes increase the potential of this region, which increases the forward-biased B–E voltage of the npn bipolar transistor, and the transistor action. The transistor action of the npn increases the collector current \\( I_{c2} \\), which starts the transistor action of the pnp bipolar transistor, and the entire pnnp device can be turned on into its low-impedance state. The gate current required to switch the SCR into its on condition is typically in the milliamp range. SCR can be turned on with a small gate current, which can control hundreds of amperes of anode current. The gate current can be turned off and the SCR will remain in its conducting state. The gate loses control of the device once the SCR is triggered into its conducting state. The current–voltage characteristics of the SCR as a function of gate current is shown in Figure 15.34.\n\nA simple application of an SCR in a half-wave control circuit is shown in Figure 15.35a. The input signal is an ac voltage and a trigger pulse will control the turn-on of the SCR. We assume that the trigger pulse occurs at time \\( t_1 \\) during the ac voltage cycle. Prior to \\( t_1 \\), the SCR is off so that the current in the load is zero; thus, there is a zero output voltage. At \\( t = t_1 \\), the SCR is triggered on and the input voltage appears across the load (neglecting the voltage drop across the SCR). The SCR turns off when the anode-to-cathode voltage becomes zero even though the trigger pulse has been turned off prior to this time. The time at which the SCR is triggered during the voltage cycle can be varied, changing the amount of power delivered to the load. Full-wave control circuits can be designed to increase efficiency and degree of control.\n\nThe gate allows control of the turn-on of the SCR. However, the four-layer pnnp structure can also be triggered on by other means. In many integrated circuits, parasitic pnnp structures exist. One such example is the CMOS structure that we considered in Chapter 10. A transient ionizing radiation pulse can trigger the parasitic structure.\n\n\n**Figure 15.34 | Current–voltage characteristics of an SCR.**\n\n| \\( I_a \\) | \\( I_a = 0 \\) | \\( I_{g1} \\) | \\( I_{g2} \\) | \\( I_{g3} \\) | \\( I_{g4} = 0 \\) |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|\n|           | \\( I_{g1} \\) | \\( I_{g2} \\) | \\( I_{g3} \\) |              | \\( V_{AK} \\)     |\n|           | \\( 0 < I_{g1} < I_{g2} < I_{g3} \\) | | | | |\n\n**Figure 15.35** (a) Simple SCR circuit. (b) Input AC voltage signal and trigger pulse. (c) Output voltage versus time.\n\nA four-layer device by generating electron–hole pairs, particularly in the \\( J_2 \\) junction, producing a photocurrent. The photocurrent is equivalent to a gate current in an SCR so the parasitic device can be switched into its conducting state. Again, once the device is switched on, it will remain in its conducting state even when the radiation ceases. An optical signal can also trigger the device in the same manner by generating electron–hole pairs.\n\nAnother triggering mechanism in the npnp device is \\( dV/dt \\) triggering. If the forward-bias anode voltage is applied rapidly, the voltage across the \\( J_2 \\) junction will also change quickly. This changing reverse-biased \\( J_2 \\) junction voltage means that the space charge region width is increasing; thus, electrons are being removed from the \\( n_1 \\) side of the junction and holes are being removed from the \\( p_2 \\) side of the junction.\n\nIf \\( dV/dt \\) is large, the rate of removal of these carriers is rapid, which leads to a large transient current that is equivalent to a gate current and can trigger the device into a low-impedance conducting state. In SCR devices, a \\( dV/dt \\) rating is usually specified. However, in parasitic pnpn structures, the \\( dV/dt \\) triggering mechanism is a potential problem.\n\n### 15.6.3 SCR Turn-Off\n\nSwitching the four-layer pnpn structure from its conducting state to its blocking state can be accomplished if the current \\( I_A \\) is reduced below the value creating the \\( \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = 1 \\) condition. This critical \\( I_A \\) current is called the holding current. If a parasitic four-layer structure is triggered into the conducting state, the effective anode current in the device must be reduced below the corresponding holding current in order to turn off the device. This requirement essentially implies that all power supplies must be turned off in order to bring the parasitic device back into its blocking state.\n\nThe SCR can be triggered on by supplying holes to the \\( p_2 \\) region of the device. The SCR can perhaps be turned off by removing holes from this same region. If the reverse gate current is large enough to bring the npn bipolar transistor out of saturation, then the SCR can be switched from the conducting state into the blocking state. However, the lateral dimensions of the device may be large enough so that nonuniform biasing in the \\( J_2 \\) and \\( J_3 \\) junctions occurs during a negative gate current and the device will remain in the low-impedance conducting state. The four-layer pnpn device must be specifically designed for a turn-off capability.\n\n### 15.6.4 Device Structures\n\nMany thyristor structures have been fabricated with specific characteristics for specific applications. We consider a few of these types of device to gain an appreciation for the variety of structures.\n\n**Basic SCR**  \nThere are many variations of diffusion, implantation, and epitaxial growth that can be used in the fabrication of the SCR device. The basic structure is shown in Figure 15.36. The \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) regions are diffused into a fairly high resistivity \\( n \\) material. The \\( n^+ \\) cathode is formed and the \\( p^+ \\) gate contact is made. High thermal conductivity materials can be used for the anode and cathode ohmic contacts to aid in heat dissipation for high-power devices. The \\( n_i \\) region width may be on the order of 250 μm in order to support very large reverse-biased voltages across the \\( J_2 \\) junction. The \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) regions may be on the order of 75 μm wide, while the \\( n^+ \\) and \\( p^+ \\) regions are normally quite thin.\n\n**Bilateral Thyristor**  \nSince thyristors are often used in ac power applications, it may be useful to have a device that switches symmetrically in the positive and negative cycles of the ac voltage. There are a number of such devices, but the basic concept is to connect two conventional thyristors in antiparallel as shown in Figure 15.37a. The integration of this concept into a single device is shown in Figure 15.37b. Symmetrical \\( n \\) regions can be diffused into a pnp structure. Figure 15.37c shows the current–voltage characteristics in which the triggering into the conduction mode\n\nFigure 15.36\nThe basic SCR device structure.\n\nFigure 15.37\n- **(a)** The antiparallel connection of two thyristors to form a bilateral device.\n- **(b)** The bilateral thyristor as an integrated device.\n- **(c)** The current–voltage characteristics of the bilateral thyristor. *(From Ghandhi [7].)*\n\nWould be due to breakdown triggering. The two terminals alternately share the role of anode and cathode during successive half cycles of the AC voltage.\n\nTriggering by a gate control is more complex for this device since a single gate region must serve for both of the antiparallel thyristors. One such device is known as a triac. Figure 15.38a shows the cross section of such a device. This device can be triggered into conduction by gate signals of either polarity and with anode-to-cathode voltages of either polarity.\n\n\n**Figure 15.38** (a) The triac device. (b) The triac with a specific bias configuration. (From Ghandhi [7].)\n\n\n**Figure 15.39** The current–voltage characteristics of the triac.\n\nOne particular gate control situation is shown in Figure 15.38b. Terminal 1 is positive with respect to terminal 2, and a negative gate voltage is applied with respect to terminal 1, so the gate current is negative. This polarity arrangement induces the current \\( I_1 \\) and the junction \\( J_4 \\) becomes forward biased. Electrons are injected from \\( n_3 \\), diffuse across \\( p_2 \\), and are collected in the \\( n_1 \\) region. In this case \\( n_3p_2n_1 \\) behaves like a saturated transistor. The collected electrons in \\( n_1 \\) lower the potential of \\( n_1 \\) with respect to \\( p_2 \\). The current across the \\( p_2n_1 \\) junction increases, which can trigger the \\( p_2n_1p_1n_3 \\) thyristor into its conducting mode.\n\nWe can show that the other combinations of gate, anode, and cathode voltages will also trigger the triac into conduction. Figure 15.39 shows the terminal characteristics.\n\n**Figure 15.40** The V groove MOS gated thyristor.  \n*(From Baliga [11])*\n\n**MOS Gated Thyristor**\n\nThe operation of a MOS gated thyristor is based upon controlling the gain of the npn bipolar transistor. Figure 15.40 shows a V-groove MOS gated thyristor. The MOS gate structure must extend into the n-drift region. If the gate voltage is zero, the depletion edge in the p-base remains essentially flat and parallel to the junction \\( J_2 \\); the gain of the npn transistor is low. This effect is shown in the figure by the dashed line. When a positive gate voltage is applied, the surface of the p base becomes depleted—the depletion region in the p base adjacent to the gate is shown by the dotted line. The undepleted base width \\( W_b \\) of the npn bipolar device narrows and the gain of the device increases.\n\nAt a gate voltage approximately equal to the threshold voltage, electrons from the n\\(^+\\) emitter are injected through the depletion region into the n-drift region. The potential of the n-drift region is lowered, which further forward biases the p\\(^+\\) anode to n-drift junction voltage, and the regenerative process is initiated. The gate voltage required to initiate turn-on is approximately the threshold voltage of the MOS device. One advantage of this device is that the input impedance to the control terminal is very high; relatively large currents can be switched with very small capacity coupled gate currents.\n\n**MOS Turn-Off Thyristor**\n\nThe MOS turn-off thyristor can both turn on and turn off the anode current by applying a signal to a MOS gate terminal. The basic device structure is shown in Figure 15.41. By applying a positive gate voltage, the n\\(^+\\)p bipolar transistor can be turned on as just discussed. Once the thyristor is turned on, the device can be turned off by applying a negative gate voltage: the negative gate voltage turns on the p-channel MOS transistor that effectively short circuits the B–E junction of the n\\(^+\\)pn bipolar transistor. Holes that now enter the p-base have an alternative path to the cathode. If the resistance of the p-channel MOSFET becomes low enough, all current will be diverted away from the n\\(^+\\)p emitter and the n\\(^+\\)pn device will effectively be turned off.\n\n**Figure 15.41** (a) The MOS turn-off thyristor.
